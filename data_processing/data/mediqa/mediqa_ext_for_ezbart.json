        "document": "Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome: Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is a rare disease passed down through families. The person is unable to fully absorb dietary fats through the intestines. Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is caused by a defect in a gene that tells the body to create lipoproteins (molecules of fat combined with protein). The defect makes it hard for the body to properly digest fat and essential vitamins.   It is an autosomal recessive condition that more often affects males. Symptoms include:     - Balance and coordination difficulties   - Curvature of spine   - Decreased vision that gets worse over time   - Developmental delay   - Failure to thrive (grow) in infancy   - Muscle weakness   - Poor muscle coordination that usually develops after age 10   - Protruding abdomen   - Slurred speech   - Stool abnormalities, including fatty stools that appear pale in color, frothy stools, and abnormally foul-smelling stools There may be damage to the retina of the eye (retinitis pigmentosa).   Tests that may be done to help diagnose this condition include:     - Apolipoprotein B blood test   - Blood tests to look for vitamin deficiencies (fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K)   - \"Burr-cell\" malformation of the red cells (acanthocytosis)   - Complete blood count (CBC)   - Cholesterol studies   - Electromyography   - Eye exam   - Nerve conduction velocity   - Stool sample analysis      Genetic testing may be available for mutations in the MTP gene. Treatment involves large doses of vitamin supplements containing fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K).   Linoleic acid supplements are also recommended.   People with this condition should talk to a nutritionist. Diet changes are needed to prevent stomach problems. This involves:     - Limiting fat intake to 5 to 20 grams per day.   - Do not eat more than 5 ounces daily (140 grams) of lean meat, fish, or poultry.   - Use skim milk instead of whole milk.      Supplements of medium-chain triglycerides are taken under the supervision of a health care provider. They should be used with caution, because they may cause liver damage. How well a person does depends on the amount of brain and nervous system problems. Complications may include:     - Blindness   - Mental deterioration   - Loss of function of peripheral nerves, uncoordinated movement (ataxia) Call your provider if your infant or child has symptoms of this disease. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition and the risks of inheriting it, and learn how to care for the person. High doses of fat-soluble vitamins may slow the progression of some problems, such as retina damage and decreased vision.

Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the MTTP gene . The MTTP gene gives the body instructions to make a protein needed for creating beta-lipoproteins. These lipoproteins are necessary for the body to absorb fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A,\u00a0D, E and K), and for transporting these substances\u00a0in the blood. Mutations in the MTTP\u00a0result in a lack of beta-lipoproteins, leading to an inability to absorb and transport these substances. This in turn leads to the nutritional and neurologic problems\u00a0in affected people. [1] Abetalipoproteinemia\u00a0is inherited in an\u00a0 autosomal recessive \u00a0manner. [4] This means that to be affected, a person must have a\u00a0 mutation \u00a0in both copies of the responsible\u00a0 gene \u00a0in each cell . Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a\u00a0 carrier . Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent 25% chance to be unaffected\u00a0and\u00a0not be a carrier The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests available for abetalipoproteinemia. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. Prenatal testing may be available for pregnancies at increased risk if the mutations in the family have been identified. A nutritionist or other qualified medical professional should be consulted for\u00a0specific dietary instruction in people with abetalipoproteinemia. Treatment involves very large doses of vitamin E, as well as large doses of vitamin supplements containing other fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K). Linoleic acid supplements are also recommended. [3] [2] Several diet changes and/or restrictions are also needed to prevent stomach problems. A low-fat diet may help with digestive symptoms; medium chain triglycerides may be used (under supervision of a specialist) as a source of fat in the diet. [3] Management in adults typically focuses on specific complications associated with the disorder, and depends on the signs and symptoms present. Affected people may need consultations with several other types of specialists, including a lipidologist, gastroenterologist , hepatologist , ophthalmologist , and neurologist . [2] The long-term outlook ( prognosis ) is reasonably good for most people who are diagnosed and treated early. [2] However, how well each person does depends on the amount of brain and nervous system problems. [3] Therefore, the prognosis can vary. [5] People with prolonged vitamin deficiency, especially of vitamin E, may develop very limiting ataxia and gait disturbances.\u00a0Some people may develop retinal degeneration and blindness.

        "document": "abetalipoproteinemia: Abetalipoproteinemia is an inherited disorder that affects the absorption of dietary fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins. People affected by this disorder are not able to make certain lipoproteins, which are particles that carry fats and fat-like substances (such as cholesterol) in the blood. Specifically, people with abetalipoproteinemia are missing a group of lipoproteins called beta-lipoproteins. An inability to make beta-lipoproteins causes severely reduced absorption (malabsorption) of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K) from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. Sufficient levels of fats, cholesterol, and vitamins are necessary for normal growth, development, and maintenance of the body's cells and tissues, particularly nerve cells and tissues in the eye.   The signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia appear in the first few months of life. They can include failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); diarrhea; abnormal star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis); and fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea). Other features of this disorder may develop later in childhood and often impair the function of the nervous system. Disturbances in nerve function may cause affected people to eventually develop poor muscle coordination and difficulty with balance and movement (ataxia). Individuals with this condition may also develop an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, in which progressive degeneration of the light-sensitive layer (retina) at the back of the eye can cause vision loss. Adults in their thirties or forties may have increasing difficulty with balance and walking. Many of the signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia result from a severe vitamin deficiency, especially a deficiency of vitamin E. Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare disorder with approximately 100 cases described worldwide. Mutations in the MTTP gene cause abetalipoproteinemia. The MTTP gene provides instructions for making a protein called microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which is essential for creating beta-lipoproteins. These lipoproteins are necessary for the absorption of fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from the diet and the efficient transport of these substances in the bloodstream. Most of the mutations in the MTTP gene lead to the production of an abnormally short microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which prevents the normal creation of beta-lipoproteins in the body. A lack of beta-lipoproteins causes the nutritional and neurological problems seen in people with abetalipoproteinemia. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

Because sickle beta thalassemia is associated with a variety of health problems, affected people are usually followed closely by their healthcare provider with regular physical examinations that may include specialized laboratory tests and imaging studies (i.e. chest X-ray, transcranial doppler ultrasound, ECG). Blood transfusions may be prescribed on a regular basis for affected people with a history of or risk factors for stroke and other specific health problems, such as pulmonary hypertension.

Treatments for mild thalassemia Signs and symptoms are usually mild with thalassemia minor and little, if any, treatment is needed. Occasionally, you may need a blood transfusion, particularly after surgery, after having a baby or to help manage thalassemia complications. People with severe beta-thalassemia will need blood transfusions. And because this treatment can cause iron overload, they will also need treatment to remove excess iron. An oral medication called deferasirox (Exjade, Jadenu) can help remove the excess iron. Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia may include: - Frequent blood transfusions. More-severe forms of thalassemia often require frequent blood transfusions, possibly every few weeks. Over time, blood transfusions cause a buildup of iron in your blood, which can damage your heart, liver and other organs. To help your body get rid of the extra iron, you may need to take medications that rid your body of extra iron. - Stem cell transplant. Also called a bone marrow transplant, a stem cell transplant may be an option in select cases, including children born with severe thalassemia. It can eliminate the need for lifelong blood transfusions and drugs to control iron overload. During this procedure, you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor, usually a sibling."

        "query": "Absence seizures Does any damage occurre from these spells. Mental or physical",
        "document": "Epilepsy juvenile absence: The following summary is from Orphanet, a European reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs. Orpha Number: 1941 Disease definition Juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) is a genetic epilepsy with onset occurring around puberty. JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures , frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and sporadic myoclonic jerks. Epidemiology The incidence of JAE is still unknown but it accounts for approximately 2-3% of patients with adult epilepsy in general, and about 8-10% of patients with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). No sex predominance has been observed. Clinical description JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures (only one or a few absences daily; 100% of cases), frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS; 80%) and sporadic myoclonic jerks (20%). The seizures onset is typically between 9 and 13 years of age and it manifests as a ''staring spell'' that can be accompanied by atonic postures such as drooping of the head and/or automatisms such as lip smacking. GTCS and myoclonic seizures often occur 1-10 years after the absence seizure onset. Patients with JAE usually develop normally, although uncontrolled absence seizures may have an impact on their ability to learn at school. Etiology The exact etiology of JAE is still elusive. However, genetic mutations for voltage-gated sodium channels ( CACNB4 gene (2q22-q23)), potassium channels ( CLCN2 gene (3q27.1)), and EFHC1 (6p12.3) may be involved in a subset of patients. Moreover, different mutations have been found in genes for GABA receptors (ligand ion channels), specifically in the GABRA1 gene (5q34). Diagnostic methods Diagnosis relies on the clinical features and on electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded awake and during sleep, that displays a generalized 3-4 Hz spike-and-slow-wave complexes. Differential diagnosis Differential diagnosis includes childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, Jeavons syndrome (see these terms). Genetic counseling The transmission is still unknown although an increased risk for first degree related parents to develop JME may exist. Management and treatment The antiepileptic drugs of choice are valproic acid (VPA) and lamotrigine (LTG). In cases where VPA deals with only partial seizure control, add-on of LTG (GTCS) or ethosuximide (absence seizures) can be beneficial. Prognosis Prognosis of JAE is usually favorable with good therapy responsiveness. Generally, seizure freedom can be achieved with antiepileptic medication in 62-84% of all patients with JAE. However, the occurrence of GTCS predicts a worse prognosis. Visit the Orphanet disease page for more resources.

        "document": "Absence seizure: An absence seizure is the term for a type of seizure involving staring spells. This type of seizure is a brief (usually less than 15 seconds) disturbance of brain function due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Absence seizures occur most often in people under age 20, usually in children ages 6 to 12.   In some cases, the seizures are triggered by flashing lights or when the person breathes faster and more deeply than usual (hyperventilates).   They may occur with other types of seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures), twitches or jerks (myoclonus), or sudden loss of muscle strength (atonic seizures). Most absence seizures last only a few seconds. They often involve staring episodes. The episodes may:     - Occur many times a day   - Occur for weeks to months before being noticed   - Interfere with school and learning   - Be mistaken for lack of attention, daydreaming or other misbehavior      Unexplained difficulties in school and learning difficulties may be the first sign of absence seizures.   During the seizure, the person may:     - Stop walking and start again a few seconds later   - Stop talking in mid-sentence and start again a few seconds later      The person usually does not fall during the seizure.    Right after the seizure, the person is usually:     - Wide awake   - Thinking clearly   - Unaware of the seizure      Specific symptoms of typical absence seizures may include:     - Changes in muscle activity, such as no movement, hand fumbling, fluttering eyelids, lip smacking, chewing   - Changes in alertness (consciousness), such as staring episodes, lack of awareness of surroundings, sudden halt in movement, talking, and other awake activities     Some absence seizures begin slower and last longer. These are called atypical absence seizures. Symptoms are similar to regular absence seizures, but muscle activity changes may be more noticeable. The doctor will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system.   An EEG (electroencephalogram) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with seizures often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures.   Blood tests may also be ordered to check for other health problems that may be causing the seizures.   Head CT or MRI scan may be done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Treatment for absence seizures includes medicines, changes in lifestyle for adults and children, such as activity and diet, and sometimes surgery. Your doctor can tell you more about these options.

        "query": "Absence seizures Does any damage occurre from these spells. Mental or physical",
        "document": "Absence seizure: Absence seizures involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness. They're more common in children than in adults. Someone having an absence seizure may look like he or she is staring blankly into space for a few seconds. Then, there is a quick return to a normal level of alertness. This type of seizure usually doesn't lead to physical injury. Absence seizures usually can be controlled with anti-seizure medications. Some children who have them also develop other seizures. Many children outgrow absence seizures in their teens. An indication of simple absence seizure is a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a lapse in attention that lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 20 seconds, without any confusion, headache or drowsiness afterward. Signs and symptoms of absence seizures include: - Sudden stop in motion without falling   - Lip smacking   - Eyelid flutters   - Chewing motions   - Finger rubbing   - Small movements of both hands Afterward, there's no memory of the incident. Some people have many episodes daily, which interfere with school or daily activities. A child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices the seizures, because they're so brief. A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of this disorder. Teachers may comment about a child's inability to pay attention or that a child is often daydreaming. Contact your doctor:  - The first time you notice a seizure   - If this is a new type of seizure   - If the seizures continue to occur despite taking anti-seizure medication Contact 911 or emergency services in your area: - If you observe prolonged automatic behaviors lasting minutes to hours - activities such as eating or moving without awareness - or prolonged confusion, possible symptoms of a condition called absence status epilepticus   - After any seizure lasting more than five minutes Many children appear to have a genetic predisposition to absence seizures. In general, seizures are caused by abnormal electrical impulses from nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. The brain's nerve cells normally send electrical and chemical signals across the synapses that connect them. In people who have seizures, the brain's usual electrical activity is altered. During an absence seizure, these electrical signals repeat themselves over and over in a three-second pattern. People who have seizures may also have altered levels of the chemical messengers that help the nerve cells communicate with one another (neurotransmitters). Certain factors are common to children who have absence seizures, including: - Age. Absence seizures are more common in children between the ages of 4 and 14.   - Sex. Absence seizures are more common in girls.   - Family members who have seizures. Nearly half of children with absence seizures have a close relative who has seizures. Your doctor will ask for a detailed description of the seizures and conduct a physical exam. Tests may include: - Electroencephalography (EEG). This painless procedure measures waves of electrical activity in the brain. Brain waves are transmitted to the EEG machine via small electrodes attached to the scalp with paste or an elastic cap. Rapid breathing (hyperventilation) during an EEG study can trigger an absence seizure. During a seizure, the pattern on the EEG differs from the normal pattern. - Brain scans. In absence seizures, brain-imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will be normal. But tests such as MRI can produce detailed images of the brain, which can help rule out other problems, such as a stroke or a brain tumor. Because your child will need to hold still for long periods, talk with your doctor about the possible use of sedation. Your doctor likely will start at the lowest dose of anti-seizure medication possible and increase the dosage as needed to control the seizures. Children may be able to taper off anti-seizure medications, under a doctor's supervision, after they've been seizure-free for two years. Drugs prescribed for absence seizure include: - Ethosuximide (Zarontin). This is the drug most doctors start with for absence seizures. In most cases, seizures respond well to this drug. Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, trouble sleeping, hyperactivity. - Valproic acid (Depakene). Girls who continue to need medication into adulthood should discuss potential risks of valproic acid with their doctors. Valproic acid has been associated with higher risk of birth defects in babies, and doctors advise women against using it during pregnancy or while trying to conceive. Doctors may recommend the use of valproic acid in children who have both absence and grand mal (tonic-clonic) seizures. - Lamotrigine (Lamictal). Some studies show this drug to be less effective than ethosuximide or valproic acid, but it has fewer side effects. Side effects may include rash and nausea. Dietary therapy Following a diet that's high in fat and low in carbohydrates, known as a ketogenic diet, can improve seizure control. This is used only if traditional medications fail to control the seizures. This diet isn't easy to maintain, but is successful at reducing seizures for some people. Variations on a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, such as the glycemic index and modified Atkins diets, though less effective, aren't as restrictive as the ketogenic diet and may also provide benefit. Additional options Here are other steps you might take to help with seizure control: - Take medication correctly. Don't adjust the dosage before talking to your doctor. If you feel your medication should be changed, discuss it with your doctor. - Get enough sleep. Lack of sleep can trigger seizures. Be sure to get adequate rest every night. - Wear a medical alert bracelet. This will help emergency personnel know how to treat you correctly if you have another seizure. - Ask your doctor about driving or recreation restrictions. Someone with a seizure disorder will have to be seizure-free for reasonable lengths of time (intervals vary from state to state) before being able to drive. Don't bathe or swim unless someone else is nearby to help if needed."

        "document": "Adrenoleukodystrophy: Adrenoleukodystrophy describes several closely related disorders that disrupt the breakdown of certain fats. These disorders are passed down (inherited) in families. Adrenoleukodystrophy is usually passed down from parent to child as an X-linked genetic trait. It affects mostly males, although some women who are carriers can have milder forms of the disease. It affects about 1 in 20,000 people from all races.   The condition results in the buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the nervous system, adrenal gland, and testes. This disrupts normal activity in these parts of the body.    There are 3 major categories of disease:     - Childhood cerebral form -- appears in mid-childhood (at ages 4 to 8)   - Adrenomyelopathy -- occurs in men in their 20s or later in life   - Impaired adrenal gland function (called Addison disease or Addison-like phenotype) -- adrenal gland does not produce enough steroid hormones Childhood cerebral type symptoms include:     - Changes in muscle tone, especially muscle spasms and uncontrolled movements   - Crossed eyes   - Handwriting that gets worse   - Difficulty at school   - Difficulty understanding what people are saying   - Hearing loss   - Hyperactivity   - Worsening nervous system damage, including coma, decreased fine motor control, and paralysis    - Seizures   - Swallowing difficulties   - Visual impairment or blindness     Adrenomyelopathy symptoms include:     - Difficulty controlling urination   - Possible worsening muscle weakness or leg stiffness   - Problems with thinking speed and visual memory     Adrenal gland failure (Addison type) symptoms include:     - Coma   - Decreased appetite   - Increased skin color   - Loss of weight and muscle mass (wasting)   - Muscle weakness   - Vomiting Tests for this condition include:     - Blood levels of very long chain fatty acids and hormones that are produced by the adrenal gland   - Chromosome study to look for changes (mutations) in the ABCD1 gene   - MRI of the head Adrenal dysfunction may be treated with steroids (such as cortisol) if the adrenal gland is not producing enough hormones.   A specific treatment for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is not available. A bone marrow transplant can cure a people of the condition. The childhood form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a progressive disease. It leads to a long-term coma (vegetative state) about 2 years after nervous system symptoms develop. The child can live in this condition for as long as 10 years until death occurs.   The other forms of this disease are milder. These complications can occur:     - Adrenal crisis   - Vegetative state Call your health care provider if:     - Your child develops symptoms of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy   - Your child has X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and is getting worse Genetic counseling is recommended for couples with a family history of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Mothers of affected sons have an 85% chance of being a carrier for this condition.   Prenatal diagnosis of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is also available. It is done by testing cells from chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. These tests look for either a known genetic change in the family or for very long chain fatty acid levels.

        "document": "What is Adrenoleukodystrophy?: X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is one of a group of genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies that cause damage to the myelin sheath, an insulating membrane that surrounds nerve cells in the brain. Women have two X chromosomes and are the carriers of the disease, but since men only have one X chromosome and lack the protective effect of the extra X chromosome, they are more severely affected. People with X-ALD accumulate high levels of saturated, very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in the brain and adrenal cortex. The loss of myelin and the progressive dysfunction of the adrenal gland are the primary characteristics of X-ALD. While nearly all patients with X-ALD suffer from adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, the neurological symptoms can begin either in childhood or in adulthood. The childhood cerebral form is the most severe, with onset between ages 4 and 10. The most common symptoms are usually behavioral changes such as abnormal withdrawal or aggression, poor memory, and poor school performance. Other symptoms include visual loss, learning disabilities, seizures, poorly articulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, disturbances of gait and coordination, fatigue, intermittent vomiting, increased skin pigmentation, and progressive dementia. The milder adult-onset form is also known as adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), which typically begins between ages 21 and 35. Symptoms may include progressive stiffness, weakness or paralysis of the lower limbs, and ataxia. Although adult-onset ALD progresses more slowly than the classic childhood form, it can also result in deterioration of brain function. Almost half the women who are carriers of X-ALS will develop a milder form of AMN but almost never will develop symptoms seen in boys the X-ALD. X-ALD should not be confused with neonatal adrenoleukodsystrophy, which is a disease of newborns and young infants and belongs to the group of peroxisomal biogenesis disorders."

Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail. Side effects may include headache, which can be severe. - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing.

        "query": "Angelman syndrome. Can a person with Angelman Syndrome have children? If so, can the disorder be passed on to offspring?",
        "document": "Angelman syndrome: Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder. It causes developmental disabilities, neurological problems and sometimes, seizures. People with Angelman syndrome often smile and laugh frequently, and have happy, excitable personalities. Developmental delays, between about 6 and 12 months of age, are usually the first signs of Angelman syndrome. Seizures often begin between the ages of 2 and 3 years old. People with Angelman syndrome tend to live a normal life span, but the disease cannot be cured. Treatment focuses on managing medical and developmental issues. Angelman syndrome signs and symptoms include: - Developmental delays, including no crawling or babbling at 6 to 12 months   - Intellectual disability   - No speech or minimal speech   - Difficulty walking, moving or balancing well (ataxia)   - Frequent smiling and laughter   - Happy, excitable personality People who have Angelman syndrome may also have other signs and symptoms, including: - Seizures, usually beginning between 2 and 3 years of age   - Stiff or jerky movements   - Small head size, with flatness in the back of the head (microbrachycephaly)   - Tongue thrusting   - Hair, skin and eyes that are light in color (hypopigmentation)   - Unusual behaviors, such as hand flapping and arms uplifted while walking Most babies with Angelman syndrome don't show signs or symptoms at birth. The first signs of Angelman syndrome are usually developmental delays, such as lack of crawling or babbling, between 6 and 12 months. If your child seems to have developmental delays or if your child has other signs or symptoms of Angelman syndrome, make an appointment with your child's doctor. Angelman syndrome is a genetic disorder. It's usually caused by problems with a gene located on chromosome 15 called the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene. You receive your pairs of genes from your parents - one copy from your mother (maternal copy) and the other from your father (paternal copy). Your cells typically use information from both copies, but in a small number of genes, only one copy is active. Normally, only the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is active in the brain. Most cases of Angelman syndrome occur when part of the maternal copy is missing or damaged. In a few cases, Angelman syndrome is caused when two paternal copies of the gene are inherited, instead of one from each parent. Angelman syndrome is rare. Researchers usually don't know what causes the genetic changes that result in Angelman syndrome. Most people with Angelman syndrome don't have a family history of the disease. Occasionally, Angelman syndrome may be inherited from a parent. A family history of the disease may increase a baby's risk of developing Angelman syndrome. Complications associated with Angelman syndrome include: - Feeding difficulties. Difficulty coordinating sucking and swallowing may cause feeding problems in infants. Your pediatrician may recommend a high-calorie formula to help your baby gain weight.   - Hyperactivity. Children with Angelman syndrome often move quickly from one activity to another, have a short attention span, and keep their hands or a toy in their mouths. Hyperactivity often decreases with age, and medication usually isn't necessary.   - Sleep disorders. People with Angelman syndrome often have abnormal sleep-wake patterns and need less sleep than most people. Sleep difficulties may improve with age. Medication and behavior therapy may help control sleep disorders.   - Curving of the spine (scoliosis). Some people with Angelman syndrome develop an abnormal side-to-side spinal curvature over time.   - Obesity. Older children with Angelman syndrome tend to have large appetites, which may lead to obesity. Your child's doctor may suspect Angelman syndrome if your child has developmental delays and other signs and symptoms of the disorder, such as problems with movement and balance, small head size, flatness in the back of the head, and frequent laughter. Confirming a diagnosis of Angelman syndrome requires taking a blood sample from your child for genetic studies. A combination of genetic tests can reveal the chromosome defects related to Angelman syndrome. These tests may review: - Parental DNA pattern. This test, known as a DNA methylation test, screens for three of the four known genetic abnormalities that cause Angelman syndrome. - Missing chromosomes. Either a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test or a comparative genomic hybridization test (CGH) can show if portions of chromosomes are missing. - Gene mutation. Rarely, Angelman syndrome may occur when a person's maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is active, but mutated. If results from a DNA methylation test are normal, your child's doctor may order a UBE3A gene sequencing test to look for a maternal mutation. There's no cure for Angelman syndrome. Research is focusing on targeting specific genes for treatment. Current treatment focuses on managing the medical and developmental issues. A team of health care professionals will likely work with you to manage your child's condition. Depending on your child's signs and symptoms, treatment for Angelman syndrome may involve: - Anti-seizure medication to control seizures - Physical therapy to help with walking and movement problems - Communication therapy, which may include sign language and picture communication - Behavior therapy to help overcome hyperactivity and a short attention span and to aid in development"

        "document": "Angelman syndrome: Angelman syndrome is a complex genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. Characteristic features of this condition include delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and problems with movement and balance (ataxia). Most affected children also have recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and a small head size (microcephaly). Delayed development becomes noticeable by the age of 6 to 12 months, and other common signs and symptoms usually appear in early childhood.   Children with Angelman syndrome typically have a happy, excitable demeanor with frequent smiling, laughter, and hand-flapping movements. Hyperactivity, a short attention span, and a fascination with water are common. Most affected children also have difficulty sleeping and need less sleep than usual.   With age, people with Angelman syndrome become less excitable, and the sleeping problems tend to improve. However, affected individuals continue to have intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and seizures throughout their lives. Adults with Angelman syndrome have distinctive facial features that may be described as \"coarse.\" Other common features include unusually fair skin with light-colored hair and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). The life expectancy of people with this condition appears to be nearly normal. Angelman syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 12,000 to 20,000 people. Many of the characteristic features of Angelman syndrome result from the loss of function of a gene called UBE3A. People normally inherit one copy of the UBE3A gene from each parent. Both copies of this gene are turned on (active) in many of the body's tissues. In certain areas of the brain, however, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternal copy) is active. This parent-specific gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. If the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is lost because of a chromosomal change or a gene mutation, a person will have no active copies of the gene in some parts of the brain.   Several different genetic mechanisms can inactivate or delete the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene. Most cases of Angelman syndrome (about 70 percent) occur when a segment of the maternal chromosome 15 containing this gene is deleted. In other cases (about 11 percent), Angelman syndrome is caused by a mutation in the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene.   In a small percentage of cases, Angelman syndrome results when a person inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from his or her father (paternal copies) instead of one copy from each parent. This phenomenon is called paternal uniparental disomy. Rarely, Angelman syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation, or by a mutation or other defect in the region of DNA that controls activation of the UBE3A gene. These genetic changes can abnormally turn off (inactivate) UBE3A or other genes on the maternal copy of chromosome 15.   The causes of Angelman syndrome are unknown in 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals. Changes involving other genes or chromosomes may be responsible for the disorder in these cases.   In some people who have Angelman syndrome, the loss of a gene called OCA2 is associated with light-colored hair and fair skin. The OCA2 gene is located on the segment of chromosome 15 that is often deleted in people with this disorder. However, loss of the OCA2 gene does not cause the other signs and symptoms of Angelman syndrome. The protein produced from this gene helps determine the coloring (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes. Most cases of Angelman syndrome are not inherited, particularly those caused by a deletion in the maternal chromosome 15 or by paternal uniparental disomy. These genetic changes occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early embryonic development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family.   Rarely, a genetic change responsible for Angelman syndrome can be inherited. For example, it is possible for a mutation in the UBE3A gene or in the nearby region of DNA that controls gene activation to be passed from one generation to the next. Buiting K.

        "document": "Hairy cell leukemia (Treatment): Treatment isn't always necessary for people with hairy cell leukemia. Because this cancer progresses very slowly and sometimes doesn't progress at all, some people prefer to wait to treat their cancer only if it causes signs and symptoms. The majority of people with hairy cell leukemia eventually need treatment. If your hairy cell leukemia causes signs and symptoms, you may decide to undergo treatment. There is no cure for hairy cell leukemia. But treatments are effective at putting hairy cell leukemia in remission for years. Chemotherapy Doctors consider chemotherapy drugs the first line of treatment for hairy cell leukemia. The great majority of people will experience complete or partial remission through the use of chemotherapy. Two chemotherapy drugs are used in hairy cell leukemia: - Cladribine. Treatment for hairy cell leukemia typically begins with cladribine. You receive a continuous infusion of the drug into a vein over several days. Most people who receive cladribine experience a complete remission that can last for several years. If your hairy cell leukemia returns, you can be treated with cladribine again. Side effects of cladribine may include infection and fever. - Pentostatin (Nipent). Pentostatin causes remission rates similar to cladribine, but it's given on a different schedule. People who take pentostatin receive infusions every other week for three to six months. Side effects of pentostatin may include fever, nausea and infection. Biological treatments Biological therapy attempts to make cancer cells more recognizable to your immune system. Once your immune system identifies cancer cells as intruders, it can set about destroying your cancer. Two types of biological treatments are used in hairy cell leukemia: - Interferon. Currently, the role of interferon in hairy cell leukemia treatment is limited. You might receive interferon if chemotherapy hasn't been effective or if you can't take chemotherapy. Most people experience partial remission with interferon, which is taken for a year. Side effects include flu-like symptoms, such as fever and fatigue. - Rituximab (Rituxan). Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody approved to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, though it's sometimes used in hairy cell leukemia. If chemotherapy drugs haven't worked for you or you can't take chemotherapy, your doctor might consider rituximab. Side effects of rituximab include fever and infection. Surgery Surgery to remove your spleen (splenectomy) might be an option if your spleen ruptures or if it's enlarged and causing pain. Though removing your spleen can't cure hairy cell leukemia, it can usually restore normal blood counts. Splenectomy isn't commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia, but it may be helpful in certain situations. Any surgery carries a risk of bleeding and infection."

        "document": "Asthma (Treatment): The goals of treatment are:     - Control airway swelling   - Stay away from substances that trigger your symptoms   - Help you to be able to do normal activities without asthma symptoms     You and your doctor should work as a team to manage your asthma. Follow your doctor's instructions on taking medicines, eliminating asthma triggers, and monitoring symptoms.   MEDICINES FOR ASTHMA   There are two kinds of medicines for treating asthma:     - Control medicines to help prevent attacks   - Quick-relief (rescue) medicines for use during attacks     LONG-TERM MEDICINES   These are also called maintenance or control medicines. They are used to prevent symptoms in people with moderate to severe asthma. You must take them every day for them to work. Take them even when you feel OK.   Some long-term medicines are breathed in (inhaled), such as steroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Others are taken by mouth (orally). Your doctor will prescribe the right medicine for you.   QUICK-RELIEF MEDICINES   These are also called rescue medicines. They are taken:     - For coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, or an asthma attack   - Just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise     Tell your doctor if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more. If so, your asthma may not be under control and your doctor may need to change your dose of daily control drugs.   Quick-relief medicines include:     - Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators   - Oral corticosteroids for when you have an asthma attack that is not going away     A severe asthma attack requires a checkup by a doctor. You may also need a hospital stay. There, you will likely be given oxygen, breathing assistance, and medicines given through a vein (IV).   ASTHMA CARE AT HOME     - Know the asthma symptoms to watch for.   - Know how to take your peak flow reading and what it means.   - Know which triggers make your asthma worse and what to do when this happens.   - Know how to care for your asthma when you exercise.     Asthma action plans are written documents for managing asthma. An asthma action plan should include:     - Instructions for taking asthma medicines when your condition is stable   - A list of asthma triggers and how to avoid them   - How to recognize when your asthma is getting worse, and when to call your provider     A peak flow meter is a simple device to measure how quickly you can move air out of your lungs.     - It can help you see if an attack is coming, sometimes even before symptoms appear. Peak flow measurements help let you know when you need to take medicine or other action.   - Peak flow values of 50% to 80% of your best results are a sign of a moderate asthma attack. Numbers below 50% are a sign of a severe attack."

For causes related to oral health, your dentist will work with you to help you better control that condition. Dental measures may include: - Mouth rinses and toothpastes. If your bad breath is due to a buildup of bacteria (plaque) on your teeth, your dentist may recommend a mouth rinse that kills the bacteria. Your dentist may also recommend a toothpaste that contains an antibacterial agent to kill the bacteria that cause plaque buildup. - Treatment of dental disease. If you have gum disease, you may be referred to a gum specialist (periodontist). Gum disease can cause gums to pull away from your teeth, leaving deep pockets that fill with odor-causing bacteria. Sometimes only professional cleaning removes these bacteria. Your dentist might also recommend replacing faulty tooth restorations, a breeding ground for bacteria."

Finally, I've been told acupuncture can help for mood disorders.  Is that true for mixed bipolar and generalized anxiety disorder along with meds?  Have you ever heard of this?",
        "document": "Generalized anxiety disorder: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a mental disorder in which a person is often worried or anxious about many things and finds it hard to control this anxiety. The cause of GAD is unknown. Genes may play a role. Stress may also contribute to the development of GAD.     GAD is a common condition. Anyone can develop this disorder, even children. GAD occurs more often in women than in men. The main symptom is frequent worry or tension for at least 6 months, even when there is little or no clear cause. Worries seem to float from one problem to another. Problems may involve family, other relationships, work, school, money, and health.     Even when aware that worries or fears are stronger than appropriate for the situation, a person with GAD still has difficulty controlling them.   Other symptoms of GAD include:     - Problems concentrating   - Fatigue   - Irritability   - Problems falling or staying asleep, or sleep that is restless and unsatisfying   - Restlessness when awake      The person may also have other physical symptoms. These can include muscle tension, upset stomach, sweating, or difficulty breathing. There is no test that can make a diagnosis of GAD. The diagnosis is based on your answers to questions about the symptoms of GAD. Your health care provider will ask about these symptoms. You will also be asked about other aspects of your mental and physical health. A physical exam or lab tests may be done to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms. The goal of treatment is to help you feel better and function well in daily life. Talk therapy or medicine alone can be helpful. Sometimes, a combination of these may work best.   TALK THERAPY    Many types of talk therapy may be helpful for GAD. One common and effective talk therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you understand the relationship between your thoughts, behaviors, and symptoms. Often CBT involves a set number of visits. During CBT you can learn how to:     - Understand and gain control of distorted views of stressors, such as other people's behavior or life events.   - Recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts to help you feel more in control.   - Manage stress and relax when symptoms occur.   - Avoid thinking that minor problems will develop into terrible ones.      Other types of talk therapy may also be helpful in managing symptoms of an anxiety disorder.   MEDICINES    Certain medicines, usually used to treat depression, may be very helpful for this disorder. They work by preventing your symptoms or making them less severe. You must take these medicines every day. DO NOT stop taking them without talking with your provider.   Medicines called sedatives or hypnotics may also be prescribed.     - These medicines should only be taken under a doctor's direction.   - Your doctor will prescribe a limited amount of these drugs. They should not to be used everyday.   - They may be used when symptoms become very severe or when you are about to be exposed to something that always brings on your symptoms.   - If you are prescribed a sedative, do not drink alcohol while on this medicine.      SELF-CARE   Other than taking medicine and going to therapy, you can help yourself get better by:     - Reducing caffeine   - Not using street drugs or large amounts of alcohol   - Exercising, getting enough rest, and eating healthy foods You can ease the stress of having GAD by joining a support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Support groups are usually not a good substitute for talk therapy or taking medicine, but can be a helpful addition.   Resources for more information include:   Anxiety and Depression Association of America: www.adaa.org   National Institute of Mental Health:\u00a0www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders/index.shtml\u00a0 How well a person does depends on how severe the condition is. In some cases, GAD is long-term and is difficult to treat. Most people, though, get better with medicine and/or talk therapy. Depression and substance abuse may occur with an anxiety disorder. Call your provider if you frequently worry or feel anxious, especially if it interferes with your daily activities. Updated by: Fred K.

        "document": "Generalized anxiety disorder (Treatment): Treatment decisions are based on how significantly generalized anxiety disorder is affecting your ability to function in your daily life. The two main treatments for generalized anxiety disorder are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you. Psychotherapy Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most effective form of psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder. Generally a short-term treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on teaching you specific skills to directly manage your worries and help you gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety. Through this process, your symptoms improve as you build on your initial success. Medications Several types of medications are used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, including those below. Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects. - Antidepressants. Antidepressants, including medications in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) classes, are the first line medication treatments. Examples of antidepressants used to treat generalized anxiety disorder include escitalopram (Lexapro), duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR) and paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva). Your doctor also may recommend other antidepressants. - Buspirone. An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be used on an ongoing basis. As with most antidepressants, it typically takes up to several weeks to become fully effective. - Benzodiazepines. In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe a benzodiazepine for relief of anxiety symptoms. These sedatives are generally used only for relieving acute anxiety on a short-term basis. Because they can be habit-forming, these medications aren't a good choice if you have or had problems with alcohol or drug abuse."

Hormone therapy is an example of targeted therapy. It blocks certain hormones that fuel cancer growth.        Cancer treatment can be local or systemic:     - Local treatments involve only the area of disease. Radiation and surgery are forms of local treatment. They are most effective when the cancer has not spread outside the breast.   - Systemic treatments affect the entire body. Chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are types of systemic treatment.     Most women receive a combination of treatments. For women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer, the main goal is to treat the cancer and prevent it from returning (recurring). For women with stage IV cancer, the goal is to improve symptoms and help them live longer. In most cases, stage IV breast cancer cannot be cured.     - Stage 0 and ductal carcinoma: Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy is the standard treatment.   - Stage I and II: Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy with lymph node removal is the standard treatment. Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and other targeted therapy may also be used after surgery.   - Stage III: Treatment involves surgery, possibly followed by chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and other targeted therapy.   - Stage IV: Treatment may involve surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, other targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatments.      After treatment, some women continue to take medicines for a time. All women continue to have blood tests, mammograms, and other tests after treatment to monitor for the return of cancer or development of another breast cancer.

Medicines that treat viruses may work against some pneumonias caused by influenza and the herpes family of viruses. These medicines may be tried if the infection is caught early.   Treatment may also involve:     - Corticosteroid medicines   - Increased fluids   - Oxygen   - Use of humidified air     A hospital stay may be needed if you are unable to drink enough and to help with breathing if oxygen levels are too low.   People are more likely to be admitted to the hospital if they:     - Are older than 65 years or are children   - Are unable to care for themselves at home, eat, or drink   - Have another serious medical problem, such as a heart or kidney problem   - Have been taking antibiotics at home and are not getting better   - Have severe symptoms     However, many people can be treated at home. You can take these steps at home:     - Control your fever with aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen or naproxen), or acetaminophen. DO NOT give aspirin to children because it may cause a dangerous illness called Reye syndrome.   - DO NOT take cough medicines without first talking to your provider. Cough medicines may make it harder for your body to cough up sputum.   - Drink plenty of fluids to help loosen secretions and bring up phlegm.   - Get a lot of rest. Have someone else do chores."

        "document": "Fibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals. Symptoms sometimes begin after a physical trauma, surgery, infection or significant psychological stress. In other cases, symptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event. Women are more likely to develop fibromyalgia than are men. Many people who have fibromyalgia also have tension headaches, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety and depression. While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, a variety of medications can help control symptoms. Exercise, relaxation and stress-reduction measures also may help. Symptoms of fibromyalgia include: - Widespread pain. The pain associated with fibromyalgia often is described as a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months. To be considered widespread, the pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your waist.   - Fatigue. People with fibromyalgia often awaken tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time. Sleep is often disrupted by pain, and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea.   - Cognitive difficulties. A symptom commonly referred to as \"fibro fog\" impairs the ability to focus, pay attention and concentrate on mental tasks. Fibromyalgia often co-exists with other painful conditions, such as: - Irritable bowel syndrome   - Migraine and other types of headaches   - Interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome   - Temporomandibular joint disorders Doctors don't know what causes fibromyalgia, but it most likely involves a variety of factors working together. These may include: - Genetics. Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder.   - Infections. Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia.   - Physical or emotional trauma. Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical trauma, such as a car accident. Psychological stress may also trigger the condition. Why does it hurt? Researchers believe repeated nerve stimulation causes the brains of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain (neurotransmitters). In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become more sensitive, meaning they can overreact to pain signals. Risk factors for fibromyalgia include: - Your sex. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more often in women than in men.   - Family history. You may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia if a relative also has the condition.   - Other disorders. If you have osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia. In the past, doctors would check 18 specific points on a person's body to see how many of them were painful when pressed firmly. Newer guidelines don't require a tender point exam. Instead, a fibromyalgia diagnosis can be made if a person has had widespread pain for more than three months - with no underlying medical condition that could cause the pain. Blood tests While there is no lab test to confirm a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, your doctor may want to rule out other conditions that may have similar symptoms. Blood tests may include: - Complete blood count - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate - Cyclic citrullinated peptide test - Rheumatoid factor - Thyroid function tests In general, treatments for fibromyalgia include both medication and self-care. The emphasis is on minimizing symptoms and improving general health. No one treatment works for all symptoms. Medications Medications can help reduce the pain of fibromyalgia and improve sleep. Common choices include: - Pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) may be helpful. Your doctor might suggest a prescription pain reliever such as tramadol (Ultram). Narcotics are not advised, because they can lead to dependence and may even worsen the pain over time. - Antidepressants. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) and milnacipran (Savella) may help ease the pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. Your doctor may prescribe amitriptyline or the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine to help promote sleep. - Anti-seizure drugs. Medications designed to treat epilepsy are often useful in reducing certain types of pain. Gabapentin (Neurontin) is sometimes helpful in reducing fibromyalgia symptoms, while pregabalin (Lyrica) was the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat fibromyalgia. Therapy A variety of different therapies can help reduce the effect that fibromyalgia has on your body and your life. Examples include: - Physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will improve your strength, flexibility and stamina. Water-based exercises might be particularly helpful. - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can help you make adjustments to your work area or the way you perform certain tasks that will cause less stress on your body. - Counseling. Talking with a counselor can help strengthen your belief in your abilities and teach you strategies for dealing with stressful situations. Self-care is critical in the management of fibromyalgia. - Reduce stress. Develop a plan to avoid or limit overexertion and emotional stress. Allow yourself time each day to relax. That may mean learning how to say no without guilt. But try not to change your routine completely. People who quit work or drop all activity tend to do worse than do those who remain active. Try stress management techniques, such as deep-breathing exercises or meditation. - Get enough sleep. Because fatigue is one of the main characteristics of fibromyalgia, getting sufficient sleep is essential. In addition to allotting enough time for sleep, practice good sleep habits, such as going to bed and getting up at the same time each day and limiting daytime napping. - Exercise regularly. At first, exercise may increase your pain. But doing it gradually and regularly often decreases symptoms. Appropriate exercises may include walking, swimming, biking and water aerobics. A physical therapist can help you develop a home exercise program. Stretching, good posture and relaxation exercises also are helpful. - Pace yourself. Keep your activity on an even level. If you do too much on your good days, you may have more bad days. Moderation means not overdoing it on your good days, but likewise it means not self-limiting or doing too little on the days when symptoms flare. - Maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eat healthy foods. Limit your caffeine intake. Do something that you find enjoyable and fulfilling every day. Complementary and alternative therapies for pain and stress management aren't new. Some, such as meditation and yoga, have been practiced for thousands of years. But their use has become more popular in recent years, especially with people who have chronic illnesses, such as fibromyalgia. Several of these treatments do appear to safely relieve stress and reduce pain, and some are gaining acceptance in mainstream medicine. But many practices remain unproved because they haven't been adequately studied. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture is a Chinese medical system based on restoring normal balance of life forces by inserting very fine needles through the skin to various depths. According to Western theories of acupuncture, the needles cause changes in blood flow and levels of neurotransmitters in the brain and spinal cord. Some studies indicate that acupuncture helps relieve fibromyalgia symptoms, while others show no benefit. - Massage therapy. This is one of the oldest methods of health care still in practice. It involves use of different manipulative techniques to move your body's muscles and soft tissues. Massage can reduce your heart rate, relax your muscles, improve range of motion in your joints and increase production of your body's natural painkillers. It often helps relieve stress and anxiety. - Yoga and tai chi. These practices combine meditation, slow movements, deep breathing and relaxation. Both have been found to be helpful in controlling fibromyalgia symptoms."

        "query": "Cervical Cancer Can a long term untreated bladder infection aid in the cause of cervical cancer? And can the fact that my mom has cervical cancer aid in my chance of getting cervical cancer?",
        "document": "Cervical cancer: Cervical cancer is cancer that starts in the cervix. The cervix is\u00a0the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the third most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the routine use of Pap smears.     Cervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are 2 types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar. Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells.   Cervical cancer\u00a0usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called dysplasia. This condition can be detected by a Pap smear and is 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap smears, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap smear results.   Almost all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical cancer. Other strains can cause genital warts. Others do not cause any problems at all.   A woman's sexual habits and patterns can increase her risk of developing cervical cancer. Risky sexual practices include:      - Having sex at an early age   - Having multiple sexual partners   - Having a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities      Other risk factors for cervical cancer include:     - Not getting the HPV vaccine   - Being economically disadvantaged   - Having a mother who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage   - Having a weakened immune system Most of the time, early cervical cancer has no symptoms. Symptoms that may occur include:     - Abnormal vaginal bleeding between periods, after intercourse, or after menopause   - Vaginal discharge that does not stop, and may be pale, watery, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling   - Periods that become heavier and last longer than usual      Cervical cancer may spread to the bladder, intestines, lungs, and liver. Often, there are no problems until the cancer is advanced and has spread. Symptoms of advanced cervical cancer may include:     - Back pain   - Bone pain or fractures   - Fatigue   - Leaking of urine or feces from the vagina   - Leg pain   - Loss of appetite   - Pelvic pain   - Single swollen leg   - Weight loss Precancerous changes of the cervix and cervical cancer cannot be seen with the naked eye. Special tests and tools are needed to spot such conditions:     - A Pap smear screens for precancers and cancer, but does not make a final diagnosis.   - The human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test may be done along with a Pap test. Or it may be used after a woman has had an abnormal Pap test result. It may also be used as the first test.   - If abnormal changes are found, the cervix is usually examined under magnification. This procedure is called colposcopy. Pieces of tissue are removed (biopsied) during this procedure. This tissue is then sent to a lab for examination.   - A procedure called a\u00a0cone biopsy may also be done.          If cervical cancer is diagnosed, the health care provider will order more tests. These help determine how far the cancer has spread. This is called staging. Tests may include:     - Chest x-ray   - CT scan of the pelvis   - Cystoscopy   - Intravenous pyelogram (IVP)   - MRI of the pelvis Treatment of cervical cancer depends on:     - The stage of the cancer   - The size and shape of the tumor   - The woman's age and general health   - Her desire to have children in the future      Early cervical cancer can be cured by removing or destroying the precancerous or cancerous tissue. This is why routine Pap smears are so important to prevent cervical cancer. There are surgical ways to do this without removing the uterus or damaging the cervix, so that a woman can still have children in the future.   Types of surgery for early cervical cancer include:     - Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP): Uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue   - Cryotherapy: Freezes abnormal cells   - Laser therapy: Uses light to burn abnormal tissue      A hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus but not the ovaries) is not often done for cervical cancer that has not spread. It may be done in women who have had repeated LEEP procedures.   Treatment for more advanced cervical cancer may include:     - Radical hysterectomy, which removes the uterus and much of the surrounding tissues, including lymph nodes and the upper part of the vagina.   - Pelvic exenteration, an extreme type of surgery in which all of the organs of the pelvis, including the bladder and rectum, are removed.      Radiation may be used to treat cancer that has spread beyond the cervix or cancer that has returned.   Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer. It may be given alone or with surgery or radiation. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. How well the person does depends on many things, including:     - Type of cervical cancer   - Stage of cancer (how far it has spread)   - Age and general health   - If the cancer comes back after treatment      Precancerous conditions can be completely cured when followed up and treated properly. Most women are alive in 5 years (5-year survival rate) for cancer that has spread to the inside of the cervix walls but not outside the cervix area. The 5-year survival rate falls as the cancer spreads outside the walls of the cervix into other areas. Complications can include:     - Risk of the cancer coming back in women who have treatment to save the uterus   - Problems with sexual, bowel, and bladder function after surgery or radiation Call your provider if you:     - Have not had regular Pap smears   - Have abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge Cervical cancer can be prevented by doing the following:     - Get the HPV vaccine. The vaccine prevents most types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer. Your provider can tell you if the vaccine is right for you.   - Practice safer sex. Using condoms during sex reduces the risk for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).   - Limit the number of sexual partners you have. Avoid partners who are active in high-risk sexual behaviors.   - Get Pap smears as often as your provider recommends. Pap smears can help detect early changes, which can be treated before they turn into cervical cancer.   - Get the HPV test if recommended by your provider. It can be used along with the Pap test to screen for cervical cancer in women 30 years and older.   - If you smoke, quit. Smoking increases your chance of getting cervical cancer.

        "query": "Diabetes Type 2 I test before going to bed and the reading is 94 but when I test again in the morning, the reading is 165.  How can I lower it?  I eat dinner around 8PM and nothing until the next morning.",
        "document": "Diabetes type 2 - meal planning (Function): Your main focus is on keeping your blood sugar (glucose) level in your target range. To help manage your blood sugar, follow a meal plan that has:     - Food from all the food groups   - Fewer calories   - About the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal and snack   - Healthy fats     Along with healthy eating, you can help\u00a0keep your blood sugar in target range by maintaining a healthy weight. Persons with type 2 diabetes are often overweight. Losing just 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) can help you manage your diabetes better. Eating healthy foods and staying active (for example, 30 to 60 minutes of walking per day) can help you meet and maintain your weight loss goal.   HOW CARBOHYDRATES AFFECT BLOOD SUGAR   Carbohydrates in food give your body energy. You need to eat carbohydrates to maintain your energy. But carbohydrates also raise your blood sugar higher and faster than other kinds of food.   The main kinds of carbohydrates are starches, sugars, and fiber. Learn which foods have carbohydrates. This will help with meal planning so that you can keep your blood sugar in your target range.   MEAL PLANNING FOR CHILDREN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES   Meal plans should consider the amount of calories children need to grow. In general, three small meals and three snacks a day can help meet calorie needs. Many children with type 2 diabetes are overweight. The goal should be a healthy weight by eating healthy foods and getting more activity (60 minutes each day).   Work with a registered dietitian to design a meal plan for your child. A registered dietitian is an expert in food and nutrition.   The following tips can help your child stay on track:     - No food is off-limits. Knowing how different foods affect your child's blood sugar helps you and your child keep it in target range.   - Help your child learn how much food is a healthy amount. This is called portion control.   - Have your family gradually switch from drinking soda and other sugary drinks, such as sports drinks and juices, to plain water or low-fat milk.      PLANNING MEALS   Everyone has individual needs. Work with your doctor, registered dietitian, or diabetes educator to develop a meal plan that works for you.   When shopping, read food labels to make better food choices.   A good way to make sure you get all the nutrients you need during meals is to use the plate method. This is a visual food guide that helps you choose the best types and right amounts of food to eat. It encourages larger portions of non-starchy vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one quarter of the plate) and starch (one quarter of the plate). You can find more information about the plate method at the American Diabetes Association website: www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/planning-meals/create-your-plate.   EAT A VARIETY OF FOODS   Eating a wide variety of foods helps you stay healthy. Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal.    VEGETABLES (2\u00bd to 3 cups or 450 to 550 grams a day)   Choose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Non-starchy vegetables include dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as cucumber, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, cabbage, chard, and bell peppers. Starchy vegetables include corn, green peas, lima beans, carrots, yams and taro.\u00a0Note that potato should be considered a pure starch, like white bread or white rice, instead of a vegetable.   FRUITS (1\u00bd to 2 cups or 240 to 320 grams a day)   Choose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar or syrup), or unsweetened dried fruits. Try apples, bananas, berries, cherries, fruit cocktail, grapes, melon, oranges, peaches, pears, papaya, pineapple, and raisins. Drink juices that are 100% fruit with no added sweeteners or syrups.   GRAINS (3 to 4 ounces or 85 to 115 grams a day)   There are 2 types of grains:     - Whole grains are unprocessed and have the entire grain kernel. Examples are whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, amaranth, barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat, and quinoa.   - Refined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the bran and germ. Examples are white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice.     Grains have starch, a type of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates raise your blood sugar level. For healthy eating, make sure half of the grains you eat each day are whole grains. Whole grains have lots of fiber. Fiber in the diet keeps your blood sugar level from rising too fast.    PROTEIN FOODS (5 to 6\u00bd ounces or 140 to 184 grams a day)   Protein foods include meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and processed soy foods. Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying. When frying proteins, use healthy oils such as olive oil.   DAIRY (3 cups or 245 grams a day)   Choose low-fat dairy products. Be aware that milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods have natural sugar, even when they do not contain added sugar. Take this into account when planning meals to stay in your blood sugar target range. Some non-fat dairy products have a lot of added sugar. Be sure to read the label.   OILS/FATS (no more than 7 teaspoons or 35 milliliters a day)   Oils are not considered a food group. But they have nutrients that help your body stay healthy. Oils are different from fats in that oils remain liquid at room temperature. Fats remain solid at room temperature.   Limit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, deep-fried foods, bacon, and butter.    Instead, choose foods that are high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats. These include fish, nuts, and vegetable oils.   Oils can raise your blood sugar, but not as fast as starch. Oils are also high in calories. Try to use no more than the recommended daily limit of 7 teaspoons (35 milliliters).   WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL AND SWEETS?   If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal. Check with your health care provider about how alcohol will affect your blood sugar and to determine a safe amount for you.   Sweets are high in fat and sugar. Keep portion sizes small.    Here are tips to help avoid eating too many sweets:     - Ask for extra spoons and forks and split your dessert with others.   - Eat sweets that are sugar-free.   - Always ask for the smallest serving size or children's size.     YOUR DIABETES CARE TEAM IS THERE TO HELP YOU   In the beginning, meal planning may be overwhelming. But it will become easier as your knowledge grows about foods and their effects on your blood sugar. If you're having problems with meal planning, talk with your diabetes care team. They are there to help you."

        "document": "Diabetes: Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the body cannot regulate the amount of sugar in the blood. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.   To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested:     - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.   - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.        People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:     - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin   - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally   - Both of the above      There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:       - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown.   - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should.   - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2.      Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.   If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease. A high blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including:     - Blurry vision   - Excess thirst   - Fatigue   - Frequent urination   - Hunger   - Weight loss      Because type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms.   Symptoms of type 1 diabetes develop over a short period. People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed.   After many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems. These problems are known as diabetes complications, and include:     - Eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), light sensitivity, and blindness   - Sores and infections of the leg or foot, which if untreated, can lead to amputation of the leg or foot   - Damage to nerves in the body, causing pain, tingling, a loss of feeling, problems digesting food, and erectile dysfunction   - Kidney problems, which can lead to kidney failure   - Weakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections   - Increased chance of having a heart attack or stroke A urine analysis may show high blood sugar. But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes.   Your health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done.   Blood tests:     - Fasting blood glucose level. Diabetes is diagnosed if the fasting glucose level is higher than 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) on two different tests. Levels between 100 and 126 mg/dL (5.5 and 7.0 mmol/L) are called impaired fasting glucose or prediabetes. These levels are risk factors for type 2 diabetes.   - Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) test. Normal is less than 5.7%; prediabetes is 5.7% to 6.4%; and diabetes is 6.5% or higher.   - Oral glucose tolerance test. Diabetes is diagnosed if the glucose level is higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) 2 hours after drinking a sugar drink (this test is used more often for type 2 diabetes).      Screening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for:     - Overweight children who have other risk factors for diabetes, starting at age 10 and repeated every 3 years.   - Overweight adults (BMI of 25 or higher) who have other risk factors such as having high blood pressure, or having a mother, father, sister or brother with diabetes.   - Adults over age 45, repeated every 3 years. Type 2 diabetes may be reversed with lifestyle changes, especially losing weight with exercise and by eating healthier foods. Some cases of type 2 diabetes can also be improved with weight loss surgery.   There is no cure for type 1 diabetes.    Treating either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes involves medicines, diet, and exercise to control blood sugar level.   Everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your provider about seeing a diabetes nurse educator.    Getting better control over your blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels helps reduce the risk of kidney disease, eye disease, nervous system disease, heart attack, and stroke.   To prevent diabetes complications, visit your provider at least 2 to 4 times a year. Talk about any problems you are having. Follow your provider's instructions on managing your diabetes. Many resources can help you understand more about diabetes. If you have diabetes, you can also learn ways to manage your condition and prevent diabetes complications. Diabetes is a lifelong disease and there is no cure.   Tight control of blood glucose can prevent or delay diabetes complications. But these problems can occur, even in people with good diabetes control. After many years, diabetes can lead to serious health problems:     - You could have eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), and light sensitivity. You could become blind.   - Your feet and skin can develop sores and infections. After a long time, your foot or leg may need to be amputated. Infection can also cause pain and itching in other parts of the body.   - Diabetes may make it harder to control your blood pressure and cholesterol. This can lead to a heart attack, stroke, and other problems. It can become harder for blood to flow to your legs and feet.   - Nerves in your body can get damaged, causing pain, tingling, and numbness.   - Because of nerve damage, you could have problems digesting the food you eat. You could feel weakness or have trouble going to the bathroom. Nerve damage can make it harder for men to have an erection.   - High blood sugar and other problems can lead to kidney damage. Your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. They may even stop working so that you need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Keeping an ideal body weight and an active lifestyle may prevent or delay the start of type 2 diabetes. If you're overweight, losing just 5% to 7% of your body weight even helps. Some medicines can also be used to delay or prevent the start of type 2 diabetes.   At this time, type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented. But there is promising research that shows type 1 diabetes may be delayed in some high risk people.

        "query": "My cousin she is leber amaurosis she need help I don't know where to start from",
        "document": "Leber congenital amaurosis: Leber congenital amaurosis is an eye disorder that primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this disorder typically have severe visual impairment beginning in infancy. The visual impairment tends to be stable, although it may worsen very slowly over time.   Leber congenital amaurosis is also associated with other vision problems, including an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and extreme farsightedness (hyperopia). The pupils, which usually expand and contract in response to the amount of light entering the eye, do not react normally to light. Instead, they expand and contract more slowly than normal, or they may not respond to light at all. Additionally, the clear front covering of the eye (the cornea) may be cone-shaped and abnormally thin, a condition known as keratoconus.   A specific behavior called Franceschetti's oculo-digital sign is characteristic of Leber congenital amaurosis. This sign consists of poking, pressing, and rubbing the eyes with a knuckle or finger. Researchers suspect that this behavior may contribute to deep-set eyes and keratoconus in affected children.   In rare cases, delayed development and intellectual disability have been reported in people with the features of Leber congenital amaurosis. However, researchers are uncertain whether these individuals actually have Leber congenital amaurosis or another syndrome with similar signs and symptoms.   At least 13 types of Leber congenital amaurosis have been described. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause, patterns of vision loss, and related eye abnormalities. Leber congenital amaurosis occurs in 2 to 3 per 100,000 newborns. It is one of the most common causes of blindness in children. Leber congenital amaurosis can result from mutations in at least 14 genes, all of which are necessary for normal vision. These genes play a variety of roles in the development and function of the retina. For example, some of the genes associated with this disorder are necessary for the normal development of light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. Other genes are involved in phototransduction, the process by which light entering the eye is converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. Still other genes play a role in the function of cilia, which are microscopic finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of many types of cells. Cilia are necessary for the perception of several types of sensory input, including vision.   Mutations in any of the genes associated with Leber congenital amaurosis disrupt the development and function of the retina, resulting in early vision loss. Mutations in the CEP290, CRB1, GUCY2D, and RPE65 genes are the most common causes of the disorder, while mutations in the other genes generally account for a smaller percentage of cases. In about 30 percent of all people with Leber congenital amaurosis, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Leber congenital amaurosis usually has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.   When Leber congenital amaurosis is caused by mutations in the CRX or IMPDH1 genes, the disorder has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most of these cases, an affected person inherits a gene mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.

        "document": "congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the diaphragm. The diaphragm, which is composed of muscle and other fibrous tissue, separates the organs in the abdomen from those in the chest. Abnormal development of the diaphragm before birth leads to defects ranging from a thinned area in the diaphragm to its complete absence. An absent or partially formed diaphragm results in an abnormal opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity and crowd the heart and lungs. This crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from birth.   In 5 to 10 percent of affected individuals, signs and symptoms of congenital diaphragmatic hernia appear later in life and may include breathing problems or abdominal pain from protrusion of the intestine into the chest cavity. In about 1 percent of cases, congenital diaphragmatic hernia has no symptoms; it may be detected incidentally when medical imaging is done for other reasons.   Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are often classified by their position. A Bochdalek hernia is a defect in the side or back of the diaphragm. Between 80 and 90 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernias are of this type. A Morgnani hernia is a defect involving the front part of the diaphragm. This type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which accounts for approximately 2 percent of cases, is less likely to cause severe symptoms at birth. Other types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, such as those affecting the central region of the diaphragm, or those in which the diaphragm muscle is absent with only a thin membrane in its place, are rare.

        "query": "Colon cancer cure seen on tv.    My father has colon cancer and said he saw a commercial on tv about a cure for colon cancer.  He cannot remember any details about it. I was wondering if you know anything about something like this.  Please let me know.  Thank you,",
        "document": "Colon cancer: Colon cancer is cancer of the large intestine (colon), which is the final part of your digestive tract. Most cases of colon cancer begin as small, noncancerous (benign) clumps of cells called adenomatous polyps. Over time some of these polyps can become colon cancers. Polyps may be small and produce few, if any, symptoms. For this reason, doctors recommend regular screening tests to help prevent colon cancer by identifying and removing polyps before they turn into cancer. Signs and symptoms of colon cancer include: - A change in your bowel habits, including diarrhea or constipation or a change in the consistency of your stool, that lasts longer than four weeks   - Rectal bleeding or blood in your stool   - Persistent abdominal discomfort, such as cramps, gas or pain   - A feeling that your bowel doesn't empty completely   - Weakness or fatigue   - Unexplained weight loss Many people with colon cancer experience no symptoms in the early stages of the disease. When symptoms appear, they'll likely vary, depending on the cancer's size and location in your large intestine. When to see a doctor If you notice any symptoms of colon cancer, such as blood in your stool or an ongoing change in bowel habits, do not hesitate to make an appointment with your doctor. Talk to your doctor about when you should begin screening for colon cancer. Guidelines generally recommend that colon cancer screenings begin at age 50. Your doctor may recommend more frequent or earlier screening if you have other risk factors, such as a family history of the disease. In most cases, it's not clear what causes colon cancer. Doctors know that colon cancer occurs when healthy cells in the colon develop errors in their genetic blueprint, the DNA. Healthy cells grow and divide in an orderly way to keep your body functioning normally. But when a cell's DNA is damaged and becomes cancerous, cells continue to divide - even when new cells aren't needed. As the cells accumulate, they form a tumor. With time, the cancer cells can grow to invade and destroy normal tissue nearby. And cancerous cells can travel to other parts of the body to form deposits there (metastasis). Inherited gene mutations that increase the risk of colon cancer Inherited gene mutations that increase the risk of colon cancer can be passed through families, but these inherited genes are linked to only a small percentage of colon cancers. Inherited gene mutations don't make cancer inevitable, but they can increase an individual's risk of cancer significantly. The most common forms of inherited colon cancer syndromes are: - Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). HNPCC, also called Lynch syndrome, increases the risk of colon cancer and other cancers. People with HNPCC tend to develop colon cancer before age 50.   - Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). FAP is a rare disorder that causes you to develop thousands of polyps in the lining of your colon and rectum. People with untreated FAP have a greatly increased risk of developing colon cancer before age 40. FAP, HNPCC and other, rarer inherited colon cancer syndromes can be detected through genetic testing. If you're concerned about your family's history of colon cancer, talk to your doctor about whether your family history suggests you have a risk of these conditions. Association between diet and increased colon cancer risk Studies of large groups of people have shown an association between a typical Western diet and an increased risk of colon cancer. A typical Western diet is high in fat and low in fiber. When people move from areas where the typical diet is low in fat and high in fiber to areas where the typical Western diet is most common, the risk of colon cancer in these people increases significantly. It's not clear why this occurs, but researchers are studying whether a high-fat, low-fiber diet affects the microbes that live in the colon or causes underlying inflammation that may contribute to cancer risk. This is an area of active investigation and research is ongoing. Factors that may increase your risk of colon cancer include: - Older age. The great majority of people diagnosed with colon cancer are older than 50. Colon cancer can occur in younger people, but it occurs much less frequently.   - African-American race. African-Americans have a greater risk of colon cancer than do people of other races.   - A personal history of colorectal cancer or polyps. If you've already had colon cancer or adenomatous polyps, you have a greater risk of colon cancer in the future.   - Inflammatory intestinal conditions. Chronic inflammatory diseases of the colon, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, can increase your risk of colon cancer.   - Inherited syndromes that increase colon cancer risk. Genetic syndromes passed through generations of your family can increase your risk of colon cancer. These syndromes include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, which is also known as Lynch syndrome.   - Family history of colon cancer. You're more likely to develop colon cancer if you have a parent, sibling or child with the disease. If more than one family member has colon cancer or rectal cancer, your risk is even greater.   - Low-fiber, high-fat diet. Colon cancer and rectal cancer may be associated with a diet low in fiber and high in fat and calories. Research in this area has had mixed results. Some studies have found an increased risk of colon cancer in people who eat diets high in red meat and processed meat.   - A sedentary lifestyle. If you're inactive, you're more likely to develop colon cancer. Getting regular physical activity may reduce your risk of colon cancer.   - Diabetes. People with diabetes and insulin resistance have an increased risk of colon cancer.   - Obesity. People who are obese have an increased risk of colon cancer and an increased risk of dying of colon cancer when compared with people considered normal weight.   - Smoking. People who smoke may have an increased risk of colon cancer.   - Alcohol. Heavy use of alcohol increases your risk of colon cancer.   - Radiation therapy for cancer. Radiation therapy directed at the abdomen to treat previous cancers increases the risk of colon and rectal cancer. Screening for colon cancer Doctors recommend certain screening tests for healthy people with no signs or symptoms in order to look for early colon cancer. Finding colon cancer at its earliest stage provides the greatest chance for a cure. Screening has been shown to reduce your risk of dying of colon cancer. People with an average risk of colon cancer can consider screening beginning at age 50. But people with an increased risk, such as those with a family history of colon cancer, should consider screening sooner. African-Americans and American Indians may consider beginning colon cancer screening at age 45. Several screening options exist - each with its own benefits and drawbacks. Talk about your options with your doctor, and together you can decide which tests are appropriate for you. If a colonoscopy is used for screening, polyps can be removed during the procedure before they turn into cancer. Diagnosing colon cancer If your signs and symptoms indicate that you could have colon cancer, your doctor may recommend one or more tests and procedures, including: - Using a scope to examine the inside of your colon. Colonoscopy uses a long, flexible and slender tube attached to a video camera and monitor to view your entire colon and rectum. If any suspicious areas are found, your doctor can pass surgical tools through the tube to take tissue samples (biopsies) for analysis and remove polyps. - Blood tests. No blood test can tell you if you have colon cancer. But your doctor may test your blood for clues about your overall health, such as kidney and liver function tests. Your doctor may also test your blood for a chemical sometimes produced by colon cancers (carcinoembryonic antigen or CEA). Tracked over time, the level of CEA in your blood may help your doctor understand your prognosis and whether your cancer is responding to treatment. Staging colon cancer Once you've been diagnosed with colon cancer, your doctor will order tests to determine the extent (stage) of your cancer. Staging helps determine what treatments are most appropriate for you. Staging tests may include imaging procedures such as abdominal, pelvic and chest CT scans. In many cases, the stage of your cancer may not be determined until after colon cancer surgery. The stages of colon cancer are: - Stage I. The cancer has grown through the superficial lining (mucosa) of the colon or rectum but hasn't spread beyond the colon wall or rectum. - Stage II. The cancer has grown into or through the wall of the colon or rectum but hasn't spread to nearby lymph nodes. - Stage III. The cancer has invaded nearby lymph nodes but isn't affecting other parts of your body yet. - Stage IV. The cancer has spread to distant sites, such as other organs - for instance, to your liver or lung. The type of treatment your doctor recommends will depend largely on the stage of your cancer. The three primary treatment options are surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Surgery for early-stage colon cancer If your colon cancer is very small, your doctor may recommend a minimally invasive approach to surgery, such as: - Removing polyps during a colonoscopy. If your cancer is small, localized and completely contained within a polyp and in a very early stage, your doctor may be able to remove it completely during a colonoscopy. - Endoscopic mucosal resection. Removing larger polyps may require also taking a small amount of the lining of the colon or rectum in a procedure called an endoscopic mucosal resection. - Minimally invasive surgery. Polyps that can't be removed during a colonoscopy may be removed using laparoscopic surgery. In this procedure, your surgeon performs the operation through several small incisions in your abdominal wall, inserting instruments with attached cameras that display your colon on a video monitor. The surgeon may also take samples from lymph nodes in the area where the cancer is located. Surgery for invasive colon cancer If the cancer has grown into or through your colon, your surgeon may recommend: - Partial colectomy. During this procedure, the surgeon removes the part of your colon that contains the cancer, along with a margin of normal tissue on either side of the cancer. Your surgeon is often able to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum. This procedure can commonly be done by a minimally invasive approach (laparoscopy). - Surgery to create a way for waste to leave your body. When it's not possible to reconnect the healthy portions of your colon or rectum, you may need an ostomy. This involves creating an opening in the wall of your abdomen from a portion of the remaining bowel for the elimination of stool into a bag that fits securely over the opening. Sometimes the ostomy is only temporary, allowing your colon or rectum time to heal after surgery. In some cases, however, the colostomy may be permanent. - Lymph node removal. Nearby lymph nodes are usually also removed during colon cancer surgery and tested for cancer. Surgery for advanced cancer If your cancer is very advanced or your overall health very poor, your surgeon may recommend an operation to relieve a blockage of your colon or other conditions in order to improve your symptoms. This surgery isn't done to cure cancer, but instead to relieve signs and symptoms, such as bleeding and pain. In specific cases where the cancer has spread only to the liver but your overall health is otherwise good, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove the cancerous lesion from your liver. Chemotherapy may be used before or after this type of surgery. This approach provides a chance to be free of cancer over the long term. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy for colon cancer is usually given after surgery if the cancer has spread to lymph nodes. In this way, chemotherapy may help reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death from cancer. Sometimes chemotherapy may be used before surgery as well, with the goal of shrinking the cancer before an operation. Chemotherapy before surgery is more common in rectal cancer than in colon cancer. Chemotherapy can also be given to relieve symptoms of colon cancer that has spread to other areas of the body. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses powerful energy sources, such as X-rays, to kill cancer cells, to shrink large tumors before an operation so that they can be removed more easily, or to relieve symptoms of colon cancer and rectal cancer. Radiation therapy either alone or combined with chemotherapy is one of the standard treatment options for the initial management of rectal cancer followed by surgery. Targeted drug therapy Drugs that target specific malfunctions that allow cancer cells to grow are available to people with advanced colon cancer, including: - Bevacizumab (Avastin) - Cetuximab (Erbitux) - Panitumumab (Vectibix) - Ramucirumab (Cyramza) - Regorafenib (Stivarga) - Ziv-aflibercept (Zaltrap) Targeted drugs can be given along with chemotherapy or alone. Targeted drugs are typically reserved for people with advanced colon cancer. Some people are helped by targeted drugs, while others are not. Researchers have recently made progress in determining who is most likely to benefit from specific targeted drugs. Until more is known, doctors carefully weigh the possible benefit of targeted drugs against the risk of side effects and the cost when deciding whether to use these treatments. Immunotherapy Some patients with advanced colon cancer have a chance to benefit from immunotherapy with antibodies such as pembrolizumab (Keytruda) and nivolumab (Opdivo). Whether a colon cancer has the chance to respond to these immunotherapies can be determined by a specific test of the tumor tissue. Supportive (palliative) care Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. When palliative care is used along with all of the other appropriate treatments, people with cancer may feel better and live longer. Palliative care is provided by a team of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. Palliative care teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. This form of care is offered alongside curative or other treatments you may be receiving."

        "document": "Diarrhea (Treatment): Most cases of diarrhea clear on their own within a couple of days without treatment. If you've tried lifestyle changes and home remedies for diarrhea without success, your doctor might recommend medications or other treatments. Antibiotics Antibiotics might help treat diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites. If a virus is causing your diarrhea, antibiotics won't help. Treatment to replace fluids Your doctor likely will advise you to replace the fluids and salts. For most adults, that means drinking water, juice or broth. If drinking liquids upsets your stomach or causes diarrhea, your doctor might recommend getting fluids through a vein in your arm (intravenously). Water is a good way to replace fluids, but it doesn't contain the salts and electrolytes - minerals such as sodium and potassium - you need to maintain the electric currents that keep your heart beating. You can help maintain your electrolyte levels by drinking fruit juices for potassium or eating soups for sodium. Certain fruit juices, such as apple juice, might make diarrhea worse. For children, ask your doctor about using an oral rehydration solution, such as Pedialyte, to prevent dehydration or replace lost fluids. Adjusting medications you're taking If your doctor determines that an antibiotic caused your diarrhea, your doctor might lower your dose or switch to another medication. Treating underlying conditions If your diarrhea is caused by a more serious condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease, your doctor will work to control that condition. You might be referred to a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist, who can help devise a treatment plan for you."

        "query": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. I am doing a research project on this genetic disease and I would like to know more about it from a professional.  I am researching the mode of inheritance, symptoms, treatments/ support groups, and relative cost to family.",
        "document": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive form of muscular dystrophy that occurs primarily in males, though in rare cases may affect females. DMD causes progressive weakness and loss (atrophy) of skeletal and heart muscles. [1] Early signs of DMD may include delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk and difficulties learning to speak. Muscle weakness is usually noticeable by 3 or 4 years of age and begins in the hips, pelvic area, upper legs, and shoulders. The calves may be enlarged. Children with DMD may have an unusual walk and difficulty running, climbing stairs, and getting up from the floor. [2] DMD may also affect learning and memory, as well as communication and certain social emotional skills. [3] Muscle weakness worsens with age and progresses to the arms, legs and trunk. Most children with DMD use a wheelchair full time by age 13. Heart and respiratory muscle problems begin in the teen years and lead to serious, life threatening complications. [2] DMD is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the DMD gene . The DMD gene codes for the protein dystrophin. [1] [2] Dystrophin is mainly made in skeletal and heart muscle cells , but a small amount is also made in nerve cells\u00a0(neurons) in specific parts of the brain. [3] DMD is\u00a0 inherited in an X-linked recessive \u00a0pattern; however, it\u00a0may also\u00a0occur in people who do not have a family history of DMD. [2]\u00a0 While there is no known cure for DMD, there are treatments that can help control symptoms. [4] Due to the advancement of medical treatment, boys with DMD may now live into young adulthood. [2] [3] Becker muscular dystrophy\u00a0(BMD) is also caused by mutations in the DMD gene. People with BMD have less severe symptoms than DMD. In addition, symptoms start later in childhood or in adolescence and progress more slowly. [1] Symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are usually noticed in boys between 1 to 6 years of age. There is a steady decline in muscle strength between the ages of 6 and 11 years. By age 10, braces may be required for walking, and by age 13, most boys with DMD are confined to a wheelchair. The signs and symptoms are as follows: [1] [2] [3] Taking longer to learn to sit, stand, or walk on own, which is known as delayed motor development. The mean age for walking in boys with DMD is 18 months. Having a waddling walk or gait, difficulty climbing stairs, and running due to progressive muscle weakness of the leg and pelvic muscles and progressive loss of muscle mass (wasting or atrophy).\u00a0 Difficulty getting up from the floor. Child may walk his hands up his legs to stand which is known as the\u00a0Gower maneuver. Enlargement of calf muscles due to the calf muscle cells being\u00a0 Muscle weakness first affecting the muscles of the hips, pelvic area, thighs and shoulders, and later the skeletal (voluntary) muscles in the arms, legs and trunk. Tight or rigid joints (also known as contractures ) may develop as muscle loss progresses. If not treated, these will become severe, causing discomfort and restricting mobility and flexibility. Contractures can affect the knees, hips, feet, elbows, wrists and fingers. Scoliosis may develop within several years of being confined to a wheelchair. By the early teens, the respiratory and heart muscles are also affected. Breathing problems due to weakness of the diaphragm and the other muscles supporting the operation of the lungs. Skeletal changes, such as scoliosis, may also increase breathing problems. Breathing problems may become life threatening. Progressive enlargement of the heart ( cardiomyopathy ) develops. This stops the heart from pumping blood efficiently, and becomes life-threatening in many cases. Learning and memory issues (cognitive impairment) may occur in some cases, but do not worsen as the DMD progresses. Communication may be more difficult for some. Social behavior may be affected, as well as the ability to read facial cues.\u00a0\u00a0 The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the DMD gene . The DMD gene provides instructions for making a protein called dystrophin. Dystophin is primarily made in the muscle cells of the heart and skeletal muscle. The main job of dystrophin in muscle cells is to help stabilize and protect muscle fibers. [1] [2] [3]\u00a0 DMD is caused by genetic changes in the DMD gene that stop any functional dystrophin from being made. [2] When dystrophin is missing, the muscle cells become damaged more easily. In response to the damage, inflammation occurs, which only worsens the process. Over time, the muscle cells without dystrophin weaken and die, leading to the muscle weakness and heart problems seen in DMD. [2] [3] The non-progressive memory and learning problems, as well as social behavioral problems, in some boys with DMD are most likely linked to loss of dystrophin in the neurons of the hippocampus and other parts of the brain where dystrophin is normally produced in small amounts, but at this point it is not known why this occurs and why only some people with DMD have these problems. [3]\u00a0 Different genetic changes in the DMD gene can cause a spectrum of disorders known as dystrophinopathies. The dystrophinopathies can range from very mild symptoms to the more severe symptoms seen in people with DMD. Other dystrophinopathies include Becker muscular dystrophy\u00a0(BMD) and DMD-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). [2] Genetic changes causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can be passed down in families. The DMD gene is located on the X chromosome , one of the two types of sex chromosomes . Males have an X and a Y chromosome ; whereas females have two X chromosomes . Since males only have one X chromosome, they also only have one copy of the DMD gene. If this copy has a genetic change that causes DMD, the male will have DMD. Males get their X chromosome from their mother and the Y chromosome from their father. [1] [2]\u00a0 Since females have two X chromosomes, they have two copies of the DMD gene. Having two changed copies of the DMD gene that can cause DMD is unlikely, but would cause DMD in females. A female with only one changed copy of the DMD gene is called a \" carrier \". She can pass on the changed gene, but usually does not have symptoms of DMD. Carriers of changes in the DMD gene that can cause DMD are at an increased risk of developing heart problems, including cardiomyopathy . In addition, due to a process called X-inactivation , in rare cases, female carriers may have mild, moderate, or severe DMD. [2] If a man with DMD has children, all of his daughters will be carriers. Since boys inherit the Y chromosome from their father, sons will not inherit DMD from their fathers, even if the father has DMD. [1] [2] DMD DMD DMD DMD A child's doctor may suspect Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in young boys who have the signs and symptoms of DMD, including progressive muscle weakness. Family history is also important. Blood tests can be used to check for\u00a0 increased levels of certain special proteins called muscle enzymes in the blood which can leak from damaged muscles. Most commonly, the blood level of the enzyme creatine phosphokinase (CPK or CK) is checked, but a doctor may also check the blood levels of transaminases such as aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase. Finding a change in the DMD gene that can cause DMD through genetic testing confirms the diagnosis of DMD. [2] [5]\u00a0\u00a0 Testing for DMD may include: [2] [5]\u00a0 Blood test which measures the levels of serum creatine phosphokinase Molecular genetic testing Electromyography Muscle biopsy is rarely used to diagnose DMD due to the decreased cost and higher accuracy of genetic testing. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. There is no known cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) but research is ongoing. The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms of DMD and related complications caused by severe progressive muscle weakness and loss in order to maximize the quality of life.\u00a0An enlarged, weakened heart (dilated cardiomyopathy ) may be treated with medications, but in severe cases a\u00a0 heart transplant\u00a0may be necessary. Assistive devices for breathing difficulties may be needed, especially at night and as the disease progresses. [2] [6] Physical therapy Steroids\u00a0( corticosteroids ) may improve the strength and function of muscles in people with DMD, including lung function. Steroid options include: [2] [6] Prednisone \u00a0is\u00a0a steroid that has been shown to extend the ability to walk by 2 to 5 years. However, the possible side effects of prednisone include weight gain, high blood pressure , behavior changes, and delayed growth. Deflazacort (another form of prednisone), is used in Europe and believed to have fewer side effects and was recently approved in the United States by the FDA. Oxandrolone, a medication used in a research study, also has similar benefits to prednisone, but with fewer side effects. Management Guidelines Section on Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery.

        "query": "I am looking for information about Cancer of the Esophagus and I'm not finding anything on your website.",
        "document": "Esophageal cancer: Esophageal cancer is cancer that starts in the esophagus. This is the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach. Esophageal cancer is not common in the United States. It occurs most often in men over 50 years old.   There are two main types of esophageal cancer: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. These two types look different from each other under the microscope.   Squamous cell esophageal cancer is linked to smoking and drinking too much alcohol.   Adenocarcinoma is the more common type of esophageal cancer. Having Barrett esophagus increases the risk of this type of cancer. Acid reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) can develop into Barrett esophagus. Other risk factors include smoking, being male, or being obese. Symptoms may include any of the following:     - Backward movement of food through the esophagus and possibly mouth (regurgitation)   - Chest pain not related to eating   - Difficulty swallowing solids or liquids   - Heartburn   - Vomiting blood   - Weight loss Tests used to help diagnose esophageal cancer may include:     - Barium swallow   - Chest MRI or thoracic CT (usually used to help determine the stage of the disease)   - Endoscopic ultrasound (also sometimes used to determine the stage of disease)   - Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and biopsy   - PET scan (sometimes useful for determining the stage of disease, and whether surgery is possible)      Stool testing may show small amounts of blood in the stool. Upper endoscopy (EGD) will be used to obtain a tissue sample from the esophagus to diagnose cancer.   When the cancer is only in the esophagus and has not spread, surgery will be done. The cancer and part, or all, of the esophagus is removed. The surgery may be done using:     - Open surgery, during which one or two larger incisions are made.   - Minimally invasive surgery, during which a 2 to 4 small incisions are made in the belly. A laparoscope with a tiny camera is inserted into the belly through one of the incisions.      Radiation therapy may also be used instead of surgery in some cases when the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus.    Either chemotherapy, radiation, or both may be used to shrink the tumor and make surgery easier to perform.   If the person is too ill to have major surgery or the cancer has spread to other organs, chemotherapy or radiation may be used to help reduce symptoms. This is called palliative therapy. In such cases, the disease is usually not curable.   Beside a change in diet, other treatments that may be used to help the patient swallow include:     - Dilating (widening) the esophagus using an endoscope. Sometimes a stent is placed to keep the esophagus open.   - A feeding tube into the stomach.   - Photodynamic therapy, in which a special drug is injected into the tumor and is then exposed to light. The light activates the medicine that attacks the tumor. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone When the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus, surgery may improve the chance of survival.   When the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, a cure is generally not possible. Treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms. Complications may include:     - Pneumonia   - Severe weight loss from not eating enough Call your health care provider if you have difficulty swallowing with no known cause and it does not get better. Also call if you have other symptoms of esophageal cancer. To reduce your risk of cancer of the esophagus:     - DO NOT smoke   - Limit or DO NOT drink alcoholic beverages   - Get checked by your doctor if you have severe GERD   - Get regular checkups if you have Barrett esophagus Updated by: Subodh K.

        "document": "Hiatal hernia (Treatment): Most people with a hiatal hernia don't experience any signs or symptoms and won't need treatment. If you experience signs and symptoms, such as recurrent heartburn and acid reflux, you may need medication or surgery. Medications If you experience heartburn and acid reflux, your doctor may recommend: - Antacids that neutralize stomach acid. Antacids, such as Mylanta, Rolaids and Tums, may provide quick relief. Overuse of some antacids can cause side effects, such as diarrhea or sometimes kidney problems. - Medications to reduce acid production. These medications - known as H-2-receptor blockers - include cimetidine (Tagamet famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid ) and ranitidine (Zantac). Stronger versions are available by prescription. - Medications that block acid production and heal the esophagus. These medications - known as proton pump inhibitors - are stronger acid blockers than H-2-receptor blockers and allow time for damaged esophageal tissue to heal. Over-the-counter proton pump inhibitors include lansoprazole (Prevacid 24HR) and omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid). Stronger versions are available in prescription form. Surgery Sometimes a hiatal hernia requires surgery. Surgery is generally used for people who aren't helped by medications to relieve heartburn and acid reflux, or have complications such as severe inflammation or narrowing of the esophagus. Surgery to repair a hiatal hernia may involve pulling your stomach down into your abdomen and making the opening in your diaphragm smaller, reconstructing an esophageal sphincter or removing the hernia sac. Or your surgeon may insert a tiny camera and special surgical tools through several small incisions in your abdomen. The operation is then performed while your surgeon views images from inside your body that are displayed on a video monitor (laparoscopic surgery). Sometimes surgery is done using a single incision in your chest wall (thoracotomy)."

During surgery, a small incision is made at the base of the bellybutton. The herniated tissue is returned to the abdominal cavity, and the opening in the abdominal wall is stitched closed. In adults, surgeons often use mesh to help strengthen the abdominal wall."

        "document": "Inguinal hernia (Treatment): If your hernia is small and isn't bothering you, your doctor might recommend watchful waiting. In children, the doctor might try applying manual pressure to reduce the bulge before considering surgery. Enlarging or painful hernias usually require surgery to relieve discomfort and prevent serious complications. There are two general types of hernia operations - open hernia repair and laparoscopic repair. Open hernia repair In this procedure, which might be done with local anesthesia and sedation or general anesthesia, the surgeon makes an incision in your groin and pushes the protruding tissue back into your abdomen. The surgeon then sews the weakened area, often reinforcing it with a synthetic mesh (hernioplasty). The opening is then closed with stitches, staples or surgical glue. After the surgery, you'll be encouraged to move about as soon as possible, but it might be several weeks before you're able to resume normal activities. Laparoscopy In this minimally invasive procedure, which requires general anesthesia, the surgeon operates through several small incisions in your abdomen. Gas is used to inflate your abdomen to make the internal organs easier to see. A small tube equipped with a tiny camera (laparoscope) is inserted into one incision. Guided by the camera, the surgeon inserts tiny instruments through other incisions to repair the hernia using synthetic mesh. People who have laparoscopic repair might have less discomfort and scarring after surgery and a quicker return to normal activities. However, some studies indicate that hernia recurrence is more likely with laparoscopic repair than with open surgery. Laparoscopy allows the surgeon to avoid scar tissue from an earlier hernia repair, so it might be a good choice for people whose hernias recur after traditional hernia surgery. It also might be a good choice for people with hernias on both sides of the body (bilateral). Some studies indicate that a laparoscopic repair can increase the risk of complications and of recurrence. Having the procedure performed by a surgeon with extensive experience in laparoscopic hernia repairs can reduce the risks."

        "document": "Hiatal hernia: Hiatal hernia is a condition in which part of the stomach extends through an opening of the diaphragm into the chest. The diaphragm is the sheet of muscle that divides the chest from the abdomen. The exact cause of hiatal hernia is unknown. The condition may be due to weakness of the supporting tissue. Your risk for the problem goes up with age, obesity, and smoking. Hiatal hernias are very common. The problem occurs often in people over 50 years.   This condition may cause reflux (backflow) of gastric acid from the stomach into the esophagus.   Children with this condition are most often born with it (congenital). It often occurs with gastroesophageal reflux in infants. Symptoms may include:     - Chest pain   - Heartburn, worse when bending over or lying down   - Swallowing difficulty      A hiatal hernia by itself rarely causes symptoms. Pain and discomfort are due to the upward flow of stomach acid, air, or bile. Tests that may be used include:     - Barium swallow x-ray   - Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) The goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. Treatments may include:     - Medicines to control stomach acid   - Surgery to repair the hiatal hernia\u00a0and prevent reflux     Other measures to reduce symptoms include:     - Avoiding large or heavy meals   - Not lying down or bending over right after a meal   - Reducing weight and not smoking   - Raising the head of the bed 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters)     If medicines and lifestyle measures do not help control symptoms, you may need surgery. Treatment can relieve most symptoms of hiatal hernia. Complications may include:     - Pulmonary (lung) aspiration   - Slow bleeding and iron deficiency anemia (due to a large hernia)   - Strangulation (closing off) of the hernia Call your health care provider if:     - You have symptoms of a hiatal hernia.   - You have a hiatal hernia and your symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment.   - You develop new symptoms.

        "document": "Irritable bowel syndrome - aftercare: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder that leads to abdominal pain and bowel changes. Your health care provider will talk about things you can do at home to manage your condition. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be a lifelong condition. You may be suffering from cramping and loose stools, diarrhea, constipation, or some combination of these symptoms.   For some people, IBS symptoms may interfere with work, travel, and attending social events. But taking medicines and making lifestyle changes can help you manage your symptoms. Changes in your diet may be helpful. However, IBS varies from person to person. So the same changes may not work for everyone.     - Keep track of your symptoms and the foods you are eating. This will help you look for a pattern of foods that may make your symptoms worse.   - Avoid foods that cause symptoms. These may include fatty or fried foods, dairy products, caffeine, sodas, alcohol, chocolate, and grains such as wheat, rye, and barley.   - Eat 4 to 5 smaller meals a day, rather than 3 larger ones.      Increase the fiber in your diet to relieve symptoms of constipation. Fiber is found in whole grain breads and cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Since fiber may cause gas, it is best to add these foods to your diet slowly. No one drug will work for everyone. Medicines your provider may have you try include:     - Antispasmodic medicines that you take before eating to control colon muscle spasms and abdominal cramping   - Antidiarrheal medicines such as loperamide   - Laxatives, such as lubiprostone, bisacodyl , and other ones bought without a prescription   - Antidepressants to help relieve pain or discomfort   - Rifaximin, an antibiotic that is not absorbed from your intestines      It is very important to follow your provider's instructions when using medicines for IBS. Taking different medicines or not taking medicines the way you have been advised can lead to more problems. Stress may cause your intestines to be more sensitive and contract more. Many things can cause stress, including:      - Not being able to do activities because of your pain   - Changes or problems at work or at home   - A busy schedule   - Spending too much time alone   - Having other medical problems      A first step toward reducing your stress is to figure out what makes you feel stressed.     - Look at the things in your life that cause you the most worry.   - Keep a diary of the experiences and thoughts that seem to be related to your anxiety and see if you can make changes to these situations.   - Reach out to other people.   - Find someone you trust (such as a friend, family member, neighbor, or clergy member) who will listen to you. Often, just talking to someone helps relieve anxiety and stress. Call your provider if:     - You develop a fever   - You have gastrointestinal bleeding   - You have bad pain that does not go away   - You lose over 5 to 10 pounds (2 to 4.5 kilograms) when you are not trying to lose weight Updated by: Michael M.

        "document": "Irritable bowel syndrome: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder that leads to abdominal pain and bowel changes.    IBS is not the same as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The reasons why IBS develops are not clear. It can occur after a bacterial infection or a parasitic infection (giardiasis) of the intestines. This is called postinfectious IBS. There may also be other triggers, including stress.   The intestine is connected to the brain using hormone and nerve signals that go back and forth between the bowel and the brain. These signals affect bowel function and symptoms. The nerves can become more active during stress. This can cause the intestines to be more sensitive and contract more.   IBS can occur at any age. Often, it begins in the teen years or early adulthood. It is twice as common in women as in men.   \u00a0It is less likely to begin in older people above 50 years of age.   About\u00a010% to 15% of people in the United States have symptoms of IBS. It is the most common intestinal problem that causes people to be referred to a bowel specialist (gastroenterologist). IBS symptoms vary from person to person, and range from mild to severe. Most people have mild symptoms. You are said to have IBS when symptoms are present for at least 3 days a month for a period of 3 months or more.   The main symptoms include:     - Abdominal pain   - Gas   - Fullness   - Bloating   - Change in bowel habits. Can\u00a0have either diarrhea (IBS-D), or constipation (IBS-C).     Pain and other symptoms will often be reduced or go away after a bowel movement. Symptoms may flare up when there is a change in the frequency of your bowel movements.   People with IBS may go back and forth between having constipation and diarrhea or have or mostly have one or the other.     - If you have IBS with diarrhea, you will have frequent, loose, watery stools. You may have an urgent need to have a bowel movement, which may be hard to control.   - If you have IBS with constipation, you will have a hard time passing stool, as well as fewer bowel movements. You may need to strain with a bowel movement and have cramps. Often, only a small amount or no stool at all will pass.     The symptoms may get worse for a few weeks or a month, and then decrease for a while. In other cases, symptoms are present most of the time.   You may also lose your appetite if you have IBS. However, blood in stools and unintentional weight loss are not a part of IBS. There is no test to diagnose IBS. Most of the time, your health care provider can diagnose IBS based on your symptoms. Eating a lactose-free diet for 2 weeks may help the provider identify lactase deficiency (or lactose intolerance).   The following tests may be done to rule out other problems:     - Blood tests to see if you have celiac disease or a low blood count (anemia)   - Stool cultures to check for an infection      Your provider may recommend a colonoscopy. During this test, a flexible tube is inserted through the anus to examine the colon. You may need this test if:     - Symptoms began later in life (over age 50)   - You have symptoms such as weight loss or bloody stools   - You have abnormal blood tests (such as a low blood count)      Other disorders that can cause similar symptoms include:     - Celiac disease   - Colon cancer (cancer rarely causes typical IBS symptoms, unless symptoms such as weight loss, blood in the stools, or abnormal blood tests are also present)   - Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms.    In some cases of IBS, lifestyle changes can help. For example, regular exercise and improved sleep habits may reduce anxiety and help relieve bowel symptoms.   Dietary changes can be helpful. However, no specific diet can be recommended for IBS because the condition differs from one person to another.   The following changes may help:     - Avoiding foods and drinks that stimulate the intestines (such as caffeine, tea, or colas)   - Eating smaller meals   - Increasing fiber in the diet (this may improve constipation or diarrhea, but make bloating worse)      Talk with your provider before taking over-the-counter medicines.   No one medicine works for everyone. Some that your provider may suggest include:     - Anticholinergic medicines (dicyclomine, propantheline, belladonna, and hyoscyamine) taken about a half-hour before eating to control intestinal muscle spasms   - Bisacodyl to treat constipation   - Loperamide to treat diarrhea   - Low doses of tricyclic antidepressants to help relieve intestinal pain   - Lubiprostone for constipation symptoms   - Rifaximin, an antibiotic      Psychological therapy or medicines for anxiety or depression may help with the problem. IBS may be a life-long condition. For some people, symptoms are disabling and interfere with work, travel, and social activities.   Symptoms often get better with treatment.   IBS does not cause permanent harm to the intestines. Also, it does not lead to a serious disease, such as cancer. Call your provider if you have symptoms of IBS or if you notice changes in your bowel habits that do not go away. Updated by: Michael M.

Fiber is a part of foods such as whole-grain breads and cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services state in its Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 (PDF, 2.963 MB) that adults should get 22 to 34 grams of fiber a day.3While fiber may help constipation, it may not reduce the abdominal discomfort or pain of IBS. In fact, some people with IBS may feel a bit more abdominal discomfort after adding more fiber to their diet. Add foods with fiber to your diet a little at a time to let your body get used to them. Too much fiber at once can cause gas, which can trigger symptoms in people with IBS. Adding fiber to your diet slowly, by 2 to 3 grams a day, may help prevent gas and bloating."

        "document": "Frozen shoulder - aftercare: A frozen shoulder is shoulder pain that leads to stiffness of your shoulder. Often the pain and stiffness are present all the time. The capsule of the shoulder joint is made of strong tissue (ligaments) that hold the shoulder bones to each other. When the capsule becomes inflamed, the shoulder bones cannot move freely in the joint. This condition is called frozen shoulder.   Frozen shoulder may develop with no known cause. It can also occur in people who:      - Have thyroid disease, diabetes, or are going through menopause   - Have a shoulder injury   - Have had a stroke that makes them unable to use their arm   - Have a cast on their arm that holds their arm in one position Symptoms of frozen shoulder often follow this pattern:      - At first, you have a lot of pain, or a freezing feeling that prevents you from moving your arm.   - Then your shoulder becomes very stiff and hard to move, but the pain lessens. It becomes hard to reach over your head or behind you.   - Finally, the pain goes away and you can use your arm again. This is the thawing phase and can take months to end.      It can take a few months to go through these stages of frozen shoulder. The shoulder can get very painful and stiff before it starts to loosen. It can take as long as 18 to 24 months for complete healing. To help speed healing, your health care provider will likely do the following:      - Teach you exercises to restore motion in your shoulder joint.   - Refer you to a physical therapist.   - Prescribe medicines for you to take by mouth. These include drugs to reduce pain and inflammation in the shoulder joint. You may also receive a shot of anti-inflammatory drug directly into the joint.      Most people have a full recovery with full range of motion without surgery. Using moist heat on your shoulder 3 to 4 times a day may help relieve some pain and stiffness.   For pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these pain medicines at the store.     - Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.   - DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider. Get help setting up your home so that you can get to everything you need without reaching above your shoulders or behind your back.      - Keep the clothes that you wear most often in drawers and shelves that are between your waist and shoulder level.   - Store food in cupboards, drawers, and refrigerator shelves that are between your waist and shoulder level.      Get help with house cleaning, taking out the garbage, gardening, and other household tasks.   DO NOT lift heavy things or do activities that require a lot of shoulder and arm strength. You will learn some simple exercises and stretches for your shoulder.     - At first, try to do these exercises once every hour, or at least 4 times a day.   - It is more important to do the exercises often than to do them for a long time each time you do them.   - Use moist heat before the exercises to help lessen pain and increase movement.   - The exercises should focus on stretching of the shoulder and range of motion.   - Avoid exercises to strengthen your shoulder until the range of motion has returned.      Some of the exercises are:      - Shoulder stretches   - Pendulum   - Wall crawl   - Rope and pulley stretches   - Movements to help with internal and external rotation, such as hand behind back      Your provider or physical therapist will show you how to do these exercises.

        "document": "Frozen shoulder: Frozen shoulder is a condition in which the shoulder is painful and loses motion because of inflammation. The capsule of the shoulder joint has ligaments that hold the shoulder bones to each other. When the capsule becomes inflamed, the shoulder bones are unable to move freely in the joint.   Most of the time, there is no cause for frozen shoulder. Risk factors include:     - Diabetes   - Thyroid problems   - Changes in your hormones, such as during menopause   - Shoulder injury   - Shoulder surgery   - Open heart surgery   - Cervical disk disease of the neck    - Women 40 to 70 years old are most affected Main symptoms of a frozen shoulder are:     - Decreased motion of the shoulder   - Pain   - Stiffness      Frozen shoulder without any known cause starts with pain. This pain prevents you from moving your arm. This lack of movement can lead to stiffness and even less motion. Over time, you are not able to do movements such as reaching over your head or behind you. Your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and examine your shoulder. A diagnosis is often made when you are not able to rotate your shoulder.   You may have x-rays of the shoulder. This is to make sure there is no other problem, such as arthritis or calcium deposits. Sometimes, an MRI exam shows inflammation, but these types of imaging tests are not needed to diagnose frozen shoulder. Pain is treated with NSAIDs and steroid injections. Steroid injections and physical therapy can improve your motion.   It can take a few weeks to see progress. It may take as long as 6 to 9 months for complete recovery. Physical therapy is intense and needs to be done every day.   Left untreated, the condition often gets better by itself within 2 years with little loss of motion.   Risk factors for frozen shoulder, such as diabetes or thyroid problems, should also be treated.   Surgery is recommended if nonsurgical treatment is not effective. This procedure (shoulder arthroscopy) is done under anesthesia. During surgery the scar tissue is released (cut) by bringing the shoulder through a full range of motion. Arthroscopic surgery can also be used to cut the tight ligaments and remove the scar tissue from the shoulder. After surgery, you may receive pain blocks (shots) so you can do physical therapy.   Follow instructions on caring for your shoulder at home.\u00a0 Treatment with physical therapy and NSAIDs often restores motion and function of the shoulder within a year. Even untreated, the shoulder may get better by itself in 2 years.   After surgery restores motion, you must continue physical therapy for several weeks or months. This is to prevent the frozen shoulder from returning. If you\u00a0do not\u00a0keep up with physical therapy, the frozen shoulder may come back. Complications may include:     - Stiffness and pain continue even with therapy   - The arm can break if the shoulder is moved forcefully during surgery If you have shoulder pain and stiffness and think you have a frozen shoulder, contact your provider for referral and treatment. Early treatment may help prevent stiffness. Call your provider if you develop shoulder pain that limits your range of motion for an extended period.    People who have diabetes or thyroid problems will be less likely to get frozen shoulder if they keep their condition under control. Updated by: C.

        "document": "Frozen shoulder: Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is a condition characterized by stiffness and pain in your shoulder joint. Signs and symptoms typically begin gradually, worsen over time and then resolve, usually within one to three years. Your risk of developing frozen shoulder increases if you're recovering from a medical condition or procedure that prevents you from moving your arm - such as a stroke or a mastectomy. Treatment for frozen shoulder involves range-of-motion exercises and, sometimes, corticosteroids and numbing medications injected into the joint capsule. In a small percentage of cases, arthroscopic surgery may be indicated to loosen the joint capsule so that it can move more freely. It's unusual for frozen shoulder to recur in the same shoulder, but some people can develop it in the opposite shoulder. Frozen shoulder typically develops slowly, and in three stages. Each stage can last a number of months. - Freezing stage. Any movement of your shoulder causes pain, and your shoulder's range of motion starts to become limited.   - Frozen stage. Pain may begin to diminish during this stage. However, your shoulder becomes stiffer, and using it becomes more difficult.   - Thawing stage. The range of motion in your shoulder begins to improve. For some people, the pain worsens at night, sometimes disrupting sleep. The bones, ligaments and tendons that make up your shoulder joint are encased in a capsule of connective tissue. Frozen shoulder occurs when this capsule thickens and tightens around the shoulder joint, restricting its movement. Doctors aren't sure why this happens to some people, although it's more likely to occur in people who have diabetes or those who recently had to immobilize their shoulder for a long period, such as after surgery or an arm fracture. Certain factors may increase your risk of developing frozen shoulder. Age and sex People 40 and older, particularly women, are more likely to have frozen shoulder. Immobility or reduced mobility People who've had prolonged immobility or reduced mobility of the shoulder are at higher risk of developing frozen shoulder. Immobility may be the result of many factors, including: - Rotator cuff injury   - Broken arm   - Stroke   - Recovery from surgery Systemic diseases People who have certain diseases appear more likely to develop frozen shoulder. Diseases that might increase risk include: - Diabetes   - Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)   - Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)   - Cardiovascular disease   - Tuberculosis   - Parkinson's disease During the physical exam, your doctor may ask you to move in certain ways to check for pain and evaluate your range of motion (active range of motion). Your doctor might then ask you to relax your muscles while he or she moves your arm (passive range of motion). Frozen shoulder affects both active and passive range of motion. In some cases, your doctor might inject your shoulder with a numbing medicine (anesthetic) to determine your passive and active range of motion. Frozen shoulder can usually be diagnosed from signs and symptoms alone. But your doctor may suggest imaging tests - such as X-rays or an MRI - to rule out other problems. Most frozen shoulder treatment involves controlling shoulder pain and preserving as much range of motion in the shoulder as possible. Medications Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), can help reduce pain and inflammation associated with frozen shoulder. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe stronger pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory drugs. Therapy A physical therapist can teach you range-of-motion exercises to help recover as much mobility in your shoulder as possible.

Surgery for frozen shoulder is rare, but if nothing else has helped, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove scar tissue and adhesions from inside your shoulder joint. Doctors usually perform this surgery with lighted, tubular instruments inserted through small incisions around your joint (arthroscopically). Continue to use the involved shoulder and extremity as much as possible given your pain and range-of-motion limits. Applying heat or cold to your shoulder can help relieve pain. Acupuncture Acupuncture involves inserting extremely fine needles in your skin at specific points on your body. Typically, the needles remain in place for 15 to 40 minutes. During that time they may be moved or manipulated. Because the needles are hair thin and flexible and are generally inserted superficially, most acupuncture treatments are relatively painless. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) A TENS unit delivers a tiny electrical current to key points on a nerve pathway. The current, delivered through electrodes taped to your skin, isn't painful or harmful. It's not known exactly how TENS works, but it's thought that it might stimulate the release of pain-inhibiting molecules (endorphins) or block pain fibers that carry pain impulses."

        "document": "Gastroparesis (Treatment): Treating gastroparesis begins with identifying and treating the underlying condition. If diabetes is causing your gastroparesis, your doctor can work with you to help you control it. Changes to your diet Maintaining adequate nutrition is the most important goal in the treatment of gastroparesis. Many people can manage gastroparesis with diet changes and dietary changes are the first step in managing this condition. Your doctor may refer you to a dietitian who can work with you to find foods that are easier for you to digest so that you're more likely to get enough calories and nutrients from the food you eat. A dietitian might suggest that you try to: - Eat smaller meals more frequently - Chew food thoroughly - Eat well-cooked fruits and vegetables rather than raw fruits and vegetables - Avoid fibrous fruits and vegetables, such as oranges and broccoli, which may cause bezoars - Choose mostly low-fat foods, but if you can tolerate them, add small servings of fatty foods to your diet - Try soups and pureed foods if liquids are easier for you to swallow - Drink about 34 to 51 ounces (1 to 1.5 liters) of water a day - Exercise gently after you eat, such as going for a walk - Avoid carbonated drinks, alcohol and smoking - Try to avoid lying down for 2 hours after a meal - Take a multivitamin daily Here's a brief list of foods recommended for people with gastroparesis (your dietitian can give you a more comprehensive list): - White bread and rolls and \"light\" whole-wheat bread without nuts or seeds - Plain or egg bagels - English muffins - Flour or corn tortillas - Pancakes - Puffed wheat and rice cereals - Cream of wheat or rice - White crackers - Potatoes, white or sweet (no skin) - Baked french fries - Rice - Pasta - Lean beef, veal and pork (not fried) - Chicken or turkey (no skin and not fried) - Crab, lobster, shrimp, clams, scallops, oysters - Tuna (packed in water) - Cottage cheese - Eggs - Tofu - Strained meat baby food - Baby food vegetables and fruits - Tomato sauce, paste, puree, juice - Carrots (cooked) - Beets (cooked) - Mushrooms (cooked) - Vegetable juice - Vegetable broth - Fruit juices and drinks - Applesauce - Bananas - Peaches and pears (canned) - Milk, if tolerated - Yogurt (without fruit pieces) - Custard and pudding - Frozen yogurt Medications Medications to treat gastroparesis may include: - Medications to stimulate the stomach muscles. These medications include metoclopramide (Reglan) and erythromycin (Eryc, E.E.S.). Metoclopramide has a risk of serious side effects. Erythromycin may lose its effectiveness over time, and can cause side effects, such as diarrhea. A newer medication, domperidone, with fewer side effects, is also available with restricted access. - Medications to control nausea and vomiting. Drugs that help ease nausea and vomiting include prochlorperazine (Compro) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Unisom). A class of medications that includes ondansetron (Zofran) is sometimes used to help nausea and vomiting. Surgical treatment Some people with gastroparesis may be unable to tolerate any food or liquids. In these situations, doctors may recommend a feeding tube (jejunostomy tube) be placed in the small intestine. Or doctors may recommend a gastric venting tube to help relieve pressure from gastric contents. Feeding tubes can be passed through your nose or mouth or directly into your small intestine through your skin. The tube is usually temporary and is only used when gastroparesis is severe or when blood sugar levels can't be controlled by any other method. Some people may require an IV (parenteral) feeding tube that goes directly into a vein in the chest. Treatments under investigation Researchers are continuing to investigate new medications to treat gastroparesis. One example is a new drug in development called relamorelin. The results of a phase 2 clinical trial found the drug could speed up gastric emptying and reduce vomiting. The drug is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but a larger clinical trial is currently underway. A number of new therapies are being tried with the help of endoscopy - a slender tube that's threaded down the esophagus. One procedure used endoscopy to place a small tube (stent) where the stomach connects to the small intestine (duodenum) to keep this connection open. Several research trials investigated the use of botulinum toxin administered through endoscopy without much success. This treatment is not recommended. Doctors are also studying the use of a minimally invasive surgical technique when someone needs a feeding tube placed directly into the small intestine (jejunostomy tube). Gastric electrical stimulation and pacing Gastric electrical stimulation is a surgically implanted device that provides electrical stimulation to stimulate stomach muscles to move food more efficiently. Study results have been mixed. However, the device seems to be most helpful for people with diabetic gastroparesis. The FDA allows the device to be used under a compassionate use exemption for those who can't control their gastroparesis symptoms with diet changes or medications. However, larger studies are needed. Gastric pacing also involves a surgically implanted device that stimulates the stomach muscles, but this device tries to more closely mimic normal stomach contractions. Currently, the device is too large and causes discomfort. Gastric pacing devices are only available in clinical trials right now."

        "document": "Gastroparesis: Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Normally, the muscles of the stomach, which are controlled by the vagus nerve, contract to break up food and move it through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether.Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine.Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. Other identifiable causes of gastroparesis include intestinal surgery and nervous system diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis. For reasons that are still unclear, gastroparesis is more commonly found in women than in men. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014sometimes several hours after a meal. Other symptoms of gastroparesis includegastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomach pain in the stomach area abdominal bloating lack of appetitegastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomachpain in the stomach areaabdominal bloatinglack of appetiteSymptoms may be aggravated by eating greasy or rich foods, large quantities of foods with fiber\u2014such as raw fruits and vegetables\u2014or drinking beverages high in fat or carbonation. Symptoms may be mild or severe, and they can occur frequently in some people and less often in others. The symptoms of gastroparesis may also vary in intensity over time in the same individual. Sometimes gastroparesis is difficult to diagnose because people experience a range of symptoms similar to those of other diseases. Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the GI tract, and gastric emptying tests. Tests may also identify a nutritional disorder or underlying disease. To rule out any blockage or other structural problems, the health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests:Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope\u2014a small, flexible tube with a light\u2014to see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum\u2014the first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. An intravenous (IV) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. The test may show blockage or large bezoars\u2014solid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomach\u2014that are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy. Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting. A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider\u2019s office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a person\u2019s digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis. Gastric emptying scintigraphy. The test involves eating a bland meal\u2014such as eggs or an egg substitute\u2014that contains a small amount of radioactive material. The test is performed in a radiology center or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. If more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed. SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device in capsule form. The SmartPill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. The images are interpreted by a radiologist. The device is swallowed and moves through the entire digestive tract, sending information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the person\u2019s waist or neck. The recorded information provides a detailed record of how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract. Gastric emptying breath test. With this test, the person eats a special test meal that includes a natural material with a special type of carbon in it. Then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying.Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy.

Then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying.Gastric emptying breath test. Treatment of gastroparesis depends on the severity of the person\u2019s symptoms. In most cases, treatment does not cure gastroparesis, which is usually a chronic, or long-lasting, condition. Gastroparesis is also a relapsing condition\u2014the symptoms can come and go for periods of time. Treatment helps people manage the condition so they can be as comfortable and active as possible. Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. If less food enters the stomach each time a person eats, the stomach may not become overly full, allowing it to empty more easily. Chewing food well, drinking noncarbonated liquids with a meal, and walking or sitting for 2 hours after a meal\u2014instead of lying down\u2014may assist with gastric emptying.A health care provider may also recommend avoiding high-fat and fibrous foods. Fat naturally slows digestion and some raw vegetables and fruits are more difficult to digest than other foods. Some foods, such as oranges and broccoli, contain fibrous parts that do not digest well. People with gastroparesis should minimize their intake of large portions of these foods because the undigested parts may remain in the stomach too long. Sometimes, the undigested parts form bezoars.When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed. As liquids tend to empty more quickly from the stomach, some people may find a pur\u00e9ed diet helps improve symptoms. Pur\u00e9ed fresh or cooked fruits and vegetables can be incorporated into shakes and soups. A health care provider may recommend a dietitian to help a person plan meals that minimize symptoms and ensure all nutritional needs are met.When the most extreme cases of gastroparesis lead to severe nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, urgent care may be required at a medical facility where IV fluids can be given.MedicationsSeveral prescription medications are available to treat gastroparesis. A combination of medications may be used to find the most effective treatment.Metoclopramide (Reglan). This medication stimulates stomach muscle contractions to help with gastric emptying. Metoclopramide also helps reduce nausea and vomiting. The medication is taken 20 to 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. Possible side effects of metoclopramide include fatigue, sleepiness, and depression. Currently, this is the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of gastroparesis. However, the FDA has placed a black box warning on this medication because of rare reports of it causing an irreversible neurologic side effect called tardive dyskinesia\u2014a disorder that affects movement.Metoclopramide (Reglan).Erythromycin. This antibiotic, prescribed at low doses, may improve gastric emptying. Like metaclopramide, erythromycin works by increasing the contractions that move food through the stomach. Possible side effects of erythromycin include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps.Erythromycin.Other medications. Other medications may be used to treat symptoms and problems related to gastroparesis. For example, medications known as antiemetics are used to help control nausea and vomiting.Other medications.Botulinum ToxinBotulinum toxin is a nerve blocking agent also known as Botox. After passing an endoscope into the stomach, a health care provider injects the Botox into the pylorus, the opening from the stomach into the duodenum. Botox is supposed to help keep the pylorus open for longer periods of time and improve symptoms of gastroparesis. Although some initial research trials showed modest improvement in gastroparesis symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying following the injections, other studies have failed to show the same degree of effectiveness of the Botox injections.11Gastric Electrical StimulationThis treatment alternative may be effective for some people whose nausea and vomiting do not improve with dietary changes or medications. A gastric neurostimulator is a surgically implanted battery-operated device that sends mild electrical pulses to the stomach muscles to help control nausea and vomiting. The procedure may be performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. General anesthesia may be required. The gastroenterologist makes several tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscope\u2014a thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the stomach to a video monitor, giving the gastroenterologist a close-up view of the tissues. Once implanted, the settings on the battery-operated device can be adjusted to determine the settings that best control symptoms.JejunostomyIf medications and dietary changes don\u2019t work, and the person is losing weight or requires frequent hospitalization for dehydration, a health care provider may recommend surgically placing a feeding tube through the abdominal wall directly into a part of the small intestine called the jejunum. The surgical procedure is known as a jejunostomy. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center. Anesthesia is needed. The feeding tube bypasses the stomach and delivers a special liquid food with nutrients directly into the jejunum. The jejunostomy is used only when gastroparesis is extremely severe.Parenteral NutritionWhen gastroparesis is so severe that dietary measures and other treatments are not helping, a health care provider may recommend parenteral nutrition\u2014an IV liquid food mixture supplied through a special tube in the chest. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center; anesthesia is needed. The surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a chest vein, with the catheter opening outside the skin. A bag containing liquid nutrients is attached to the catheter, and the nutrients are transported through the catheter into the chest vein and into the bloodstream. This approach is a less preferable alternative to a jejunostomy and is usually a temporary treatment to get through a difficult period of gastroparesis. An elevated blood glucose level directly interferes with normal stomach emptying, so good blood glucose control in people with diabetes is important. However, gastroparesis can make blood glucose control difficult. When food that has been delayed in the stomach finally enters the small intestine and is absorbed, blood glucose levels rise. Gastric emptying is unpredictable with gastroparesis, causing a person\u2019s blood glucose levels to be erratic and difficult to control.The primary treatment goals for gastroparesis related to diabetes are to improve gastric emptying and regain control of blood glucose levels. In addition to the dietary changes and treatments already described, a health care provider will likely adjust the person\u2019s insulin regimen.To better control blood glucose, people with diabetes and gastroparesis may need totake insulin more often or change the type of insulin they take take insulin after meals, instead of before check blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessarytake insulin more often or change the type of insulin they taketake insulin after meals, instead of beforecheck blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessaryA health care provider will give specific instructions for taking insulin based on the individual\u2019s needs and the severity of gastroparesis.In some cases, the dietitian may suggest eating several liquid or pur\u00e9ed meals a day until gastroparesis symptoms improve and blood glucose levels are more stable. The problems of gastroparesis can includesevere dehydration due to persistent vomiting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagus bezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill form difficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes malnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intake decreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptomssevere dehydration due to persistent vomitinggastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagusbezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill formdifficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetesmalnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intakedecreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptoms Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014 sometimes several hours after a meal. Other common symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), pain in the stomach area, abdominal bloating, and lack of appetite. Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and gastric emptying tests. Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed. Treatment of gastroparesis may include medications, botulinum toxin, gastric electrical stimulation, jejunostomy, and parenteral nutrition. For people with gastroparesis and diabetes, a health care provider will likely adjust the person\u2019s insulin regimen.Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine.Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally.

Other common symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), pain in the stomach area, abdominal bloating, and lack of appetite.Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and gastric emptying tests.Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed.Treatment of gastroparesis may include medications, botulinum toxin, gastric electrical stimulation, jejunostomy, and parenteral nutrition.For people with gastroparesis and diabetes, a health care provider will likely adjust the person\u2019s insulin regimen.

Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Normally, the muscles of the stomach, which are controlled by the vagus nerve, contract to break up food and move it through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The movement of muscles in the GI tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Gastroparesis slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. What causes gastroparesis? Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. Other identifiable causes of gastroparesis include intestinal surgery and nervous system diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or multiple sclerosis. For reasons that are still unclear, gastroparesis is more commonly found in women than in men. What are the symptoms of gastroparesis? The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014sometimes several hours after a meal. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), also called acid reflux or acid regurgitation\u2014a condition in which stomach contents flow back up into the esophagus, the organ that connects the mouth to the stomach pain in the stomach area abdominal bloating lack of appetite Symptoms may be aggravated by eating greasy or rich foods, large quantities of foods with fiber\u2014such as raw fruits and vegetables\u2014or drinking beverages high in fat or carbonation. Symptoms may be mild or severe, and they can occur frequently in some people and less often in others. The symptoms of gastroparesis may also vary in intensity over time in the same individual. Sometimes gastroparesis is difficult to diagnose because people experience a range of symptoms similar to those of other diseases. How is gastroparesis diagnosed? Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the GI tract, and gastric emptying tests. Tests may also identify a nutritional disorder or underlying disease. To rule out any blockage or other structural problems, the health care provider may perform one or more of the following tests: Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscope\u2014a small, flexible tube with a light\u2014to see the upper GI tract, which includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum\u2014the first part of the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases. The endoscope is carefully fed down the esophagus and into the stomach and duodenum. A small camera mounted on the endoscope transmits a video image to a monitor, allowing close examination of the intestinal lining. A person may receive a liquid anesthetic that is gargled or sprayed on the back of the throat. An intravenous (IV) needle is placed in a vein in the arm if general anesthesia is given. The test may show blockage or large bezoars\u2014solid collections of food, mucus, vegetable fiber, hair, or other material that cannot be digested in the stomach\u2014that are sometimes softened, dissolved, or broken up during an upper GI endoscopy. Upper GI series. An upper GI series may be done to look at the small intestine. The test is performed at a hospital or outpatient center by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. Anesthesia is not needed. No eating or drinking is allowed for 8 hours before the procedure, if possible. If the person has diabetes, a health care provider may give different instructions about fasting before the test. During the procedure, the person will stand or sit in front of an x-ray machine and drink barium, a chalky liquid. Barium coats the small intestine, making signs of gastroparesis show up more clearly on x rays. Gastroparesis is likely if the x ray shows food in the stomach after fasting. A person may experience bloating and nausea for a short time after the test. For several days afterward, barium liquid in the GI tract causes stools to be white or light colored. A health care provider will give the person specific instructions about eating and drinking after the test. Ultrasound. Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. The procedure is performed in a health care provider\u2019s office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show whether gallbladder disease and pancreatitis could be the cause of a person\u2019s digestive symptoms, rather than gastroparesis. Gastric emptying scintigraphy. The test involves eating a bland meal\u2014such as eggs or an egg substitute\u2014that contains a small amount of radioactive material. The test is performed in a radiology center or hospital by a specially trained technician and interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. An external camera scans the abdomen to show where the radioactive material is located. The radiologist is then able to measure the rate of gastric emptying at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the meal. If more than 10 percent of the meal is still in the stomach at 4 hours, the diagnosis of gastroparesis is confirmed. SmartPill. The SmartPill is a small electronic device in capsule form. The SmartPill test is available at specialized outpatient centers. The images are interpreted by a radiologist. The device is swallowed and moves through the entire digestive tract, sending information to a cell-phone-sized receiver worn around the person\u2019s waist or neck. The recorded information provides a detailed record of how quickly food travels through each part of the digestive tract. Gastric emptying breath test. With this test, the person eats a special test meal that includes a natural material with a special type of carbon in it. Then, breath samples are taken over a period of several hours to measure the amount of the material in the exhaled breath. The results allow the health care provider to calculate how fast the stomach is emptying. How is gastroparesis treated? Treatment of gastroparesis depends on the severity of the person\u2019s symptoms. In most cases, treatment does not cure gastroparesis, which is usually a chronic, or long-lasting, condition. Gastroparesis is also a relapsing condition\u2014the symptoms can come and go for periods of time. Treatment helps people manage the condition so they can be as comfortable and active as possible. Eating, Diet, and Nutrition Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. If less food enters the stomach each time a person eats, the stomach may not become overly full, allowing it to empty more easily. Chewing food well, drinking noncarbonated liquids with a meal, and walking or sitting for 2 hours after a meal\u2014instead of lying down\u2014may assist with gastric emptying. A health care provider may also recommend avoiding high-fat and fibrous foods. Fat naturally slows digestion and some raw vegetables and fruits are more difficult to digest than other foods. Some foods, such as oranges and broccoli, contain fibrous parts that do not digest well. People with gastroparesis should minimize their intake of large portions of these foods because the undigested parts may remain in the stomach too long. Sometimes, the undigested parts form bezoars. When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed. As liquids tend to empty more quickly from the stomach, some people may find a pur\u00e9ed diet helps improve symptoms. Pur\u00e9ed fresh or cooked fruits and vegetables can be incorporated into shakes and soups. A health care provider may recommend a dietitian to help a person plan meals that minimize symptoms and ensure all nutritional needs are met. When the most extreme cases of gastroparesis lead to severe nausea, vomiting, and dehydration, urgent care may be required at a medical facility where IV fluids can be given. Medications Several prescription medications are available to treat gastroparesis. A combination of medications may be used to find the most effective treatment. Metoclopramide (Reglan). This medication stimulates stomach muscle contractions to help with gastric emptying. Metoclopramide also helps reduce nausea and vomiting. The medication is taken 20 to 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. Possible side effects of metoclopramide include fatigue, sleepiness, and depression. Currently, this is the only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of gastroparesis. However, the FDA has placed a black box warning on this medication because of rare reports of it causing an irreversible neurologic side effect called tardive dyskinesia\u2014a disorder that affects movement. Erythromycin. This antibiotic, prescribed at low doses, may improve gastric emptying. Like metaclopramide, erythromycin works by increasing the contractions that move food through the stomach. Possible side effects of erythromycin include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. Other medications. Other medications may be used to treat symptoms and problems related to gastroparesis. For example, medications known as antiemetics are used to help control nausea and vomiting. Botulinum Toxin Botulinum toxin is a nerve blocking agent also known as Botox. After passing an endoscope into the stomach, a health care provider injects the Botox into the pylorus, the opening from the stomach into the duodenum. Botox is supposed to help keep the pylorus open for longer periods of time and improve symptoms of gastroparesis. Although some initial research trials showed modest improvement in gastroparesis symptoms and the rate of gastric emptying following the injections, other studies have failed to show the same degree of effectiveness of the Botox injections.1 Gastric Electrical Stimulation This treatment alternative may be effective for some people whose nausea and vomiting do not improve with dietary changes or medications. A gastric neurostimulator is a surgically implanted battery-operated device that sends mild electrical pulses to the stomach muscles to help control nausea and vomiting. The procedure may be performed at a hospital or outpatient center by a gastroenterologist. General anesthesia may be required. The gastroenterologist makes several tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserts a laparoscope\u2014a thin tube with a tiny video camera attached. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the stomach to a video monitor, giving the gastroenterologist a close-up view of the tissues. Once implanted, the settings on the battery-operated device can be adjusted to determine the settings that best control symptoms. Jejunostomy If medications and dietary changes don\u2019t work, and the person is losing weight or requires frequent hospitalization for dehydration, a health care provider may recommend surgically placing a feeding tube through the abdominal wall directly into a part of the small intestine called the jejunum. The surgical procedure is known as a jejunostomy. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center. Anesthesia is needed. The feeding tube bypasses the stomach and delivers a special liquid food with nutrients directly into the jejunum. The jejunostomy is used only when gastroparesis is extremely severe. Parenteral Nutrition When gastroparesis is so severe that dietary measures and other treatments are not helping, a health care provider may recommend parenteral nutrition\u2014an IV liquid food mixture supplied through a special tube in the chest. The procedure is performed by a surgeon at a hospital or outpatient center; anesthesia is needed. The surgeon inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a chest vein, with the catheter opening outside the skin. A bag containing liquid nutrients is attached to the catheter, and the nutrients are transported through the catheter into the chest vein and into the bloodstream. This approach is a less preferable alternative to a jejunostomy and is usually a temporary treatment to get through a difficult period of gastroparesis. How is gastroparesis treated if a person has diabetes? An elevated blood glucose level directly interferes with normal stomach emptying, so good blood glucose control in people with diabetes is important. However, gastroparesis can make blood glucose control difficult. When food that has been delayed in the stomach finally enters the small intestine and is absorbed, blood glucose levels rise. Gastric emptying is unpredictable with gastroparesis, causing a person\u2019s blood glucose levels to be erratic and difficult to control. The primary treatment goals for gastroparesis related to diabetes are to improve gastric emptying and regain control of blood glucose levels. In addition to the dietary changes and treatments already described, a health care provider will likely adjust the person\u2019s insulin regimen. To better control blood glucose, people with diabetes and gastroparesis may need to take insulin more often or change the type of insulin they take take insulin after meals, instead of before check blood glucose levels frequently after eating and administer insulin when necessary A health care provider will give specific instructions for taking insulin based on the individual\u2019s needs and the severity of gastroparesis. In some cases, the dietitian may suggest eating several liquid or pur\u00e9ed meals a day until gastroparesis symptoms improve and blood glucose levels are more stable. What are the problems of gastroparesis? The problems of gastroparesis can include severe dehydration due to persistent vomiting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is GER that occurs more than twice a week for a few weeks; GERD can lead to esophagitis\u2014 irritation of the esophagus bezoars, which can cause nausea, vomiting, obstruction, or interfere with absorption of some medications in pill form difficulty managing blood glucose levels in people with diabetes malnutrition due to poor absorption of nutrients or a low calorie intake decreased quality of life, including work absences due to severe symptoms Points to Remember Gastroparesis, also called delayed gastric emptying, is a disorder that slows or stops the movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine. Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally.

Some treatments that look promising include: - Acupuncture and electroacupuncture. Acupuncture involves the insertion of extremely thin needles through your skin at strategic points on your body. During electroacupuncture, a small electrical current is passed through the needles. Studies have shown these treatments to ease gastroparesis symptoms more than a sham treatment. - STW 5 (Iberogast). This herbal formula from Germany contains nine different herbal extracts. It hasn't been shown to speed up gastric emptying, but was slightly better at easing digestive symptoms than a placebo. - Rikkunshito. This Japanese herbal formula also contains nine herbs. It may help reduce abdominal pain and the feeling of post-meal fullness. - Cannabis. There aren't any published clinical trials on cannabis and gastroparesis. However, cannabis - commonly known as marijuana - is thought to ease nausea and other digestive complaints. Derivatives of cannabis have been used by people who have cancer in the past, but there are better FDA-approved medications available to control nausea now. Because cannabis is often smoked, there's concern about possible addiction and harm, similar to what occurs with tobacco smoke. In addition, daily users of marijuana (cannabis) may develop a condition that mimics the symptoms of gastroparesis called cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Quitting cannabis may help."

        "document": "Gastroparesis: Gastroparesis is a condition that affects the normal spontaneous movement of the muscles (motility) in your stomach. Ordinarily, strong muscular contractions propel food through your digestive tract. But if you have gastroparesis, your stomach's motility is slowed down or doesn't work at all, preventing your stomach from emptying properly. Certain medications, such as opioid pain relievers, some antidepressants, and high blood pressure and allergy medications, can lead to slow gastric emptying and cause similar symptoms. For people who already have gastroparesis, these medications may make their condition worse. Gastroparesis can interfere with normal digestion, cause nausea and vomiting, and cause problems with blood sugar levels and nutrition. The cause of gastroparesis is usually unknown. Sometimes it's a complication of diabetes, and some people develop gastroparesis after surgery. Although there's no cure for gastroparesis, changes to your diet, along with medication, can offer some relief. Gastroparesis care at Mayo Clinic Signs and symptoms of gastroparesis include: - Vomiting   - Nausea   - A feeling of fullness after eating just a few bites   - Vomiting undigested food eaten a few hours earlier   - Acid reflux   - Abdominal bloating   - Abdominal pain   - Changes in blood sugar levels   - Lack of appetite   - Weight loss and malnutrition Many people with gastroparesis don't have any noticeable signs and symptoms. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you. It's not always clear what leads to gastroparesis. But in many cases, gastroparesis is believed to be caused by damage to a nerve that controls the stomach muscles (vagus nerve). The vagus nerve helps manage the complex processes in your digestive tract, including signaling the muscles in your stomach to contract and push food into the small intestine. A damaged vagus nerve can't send signals normally to your stomach muscles. This may cause food to remain in your stomach longer, rather than move normally into your small intestine to be digested. The vagus nerve can be damaged by diseases, such as diabetes, or by surgery to the stomach or small intestine. Factors that can increase your risk of gastroparesis: - Diabetes   - Abdominal or esophageal surgery   - Infection, usually a virus   - Certain medications that slow the rate of stomach emptying, such as narcotic pain medications   - Scleroderma (a connective tissue disease)   - Nervous system diseases, such as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis   - Hypothyroidism (low thyroid) Women are more likely to develop gastroparesis than are men. Doctors use several tests to help diagnose gastroparesis and rule out conditions that may cause similar symptoms. Tests may include: - Gastric emptying study. This is the most important test used in making a diagnosis of gastroparesis. It involves eating a light meal, such as eggs and toast, that contains a small amount of radioactive material. A scanner that detects the movement of the radioactive material is placed over your abdomen to monitor the rate at which food leaves your stomach. You'll need to stop taking any medications that could slow gastric emptying. Ask your doctor if any of your medications might slow your digestion. - Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This procedure is used to visually examine your upper digestive system - your esophagus, stomach and beginning of the small intestine (duodenum) - with a tiny camera on the end of a long, flexible tube.This test can also diagnose other conditions, such as peptic ulcer disease or pyloric stenosis, which can have symptoms similar to those of gastroparesis. - Ultrasound. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of structures within your body. Ultrasound can help diagnose whether problems with your gallbladder or your kidneys could be causing your symptoms. - Upper gastrointestinal series. This is a series of X-rays in which you drink a white, chalky liquid (barium) that coats the digestive system to help abnormalities show up. Treating gastroparesis begins with identifying and treating the underlying condition. If diabetes is causing your gastroparesis, your doctor can work with you to help you control it. Changes to your diet Maintaining adequate nutrition is the most important goal in the treatment of gastroparesis. Many people can manage gastroparesis with diet changes and dietary changes are the first step in managing this condition. Your doctor may refer you to a dietitian who can work with you to find foods that are easier for you to digest so that you're more likely to get enough calories and nutrients from the food you eat. A dietitian might suggest that you try to: - Eat smaller meals more frequently - Chew food thoroughly - Eat well-cooked fruits and vegetables rather than raw fruits and vegetables - Avoid fibrous fruits and vegetables, such as oranges and broccoli, which may cause bezoars - Choose mostly low-fat foods, but if you can tolerate them, add small servings of fatty foods to your diet - Try soups and pureed foods if liquids are easier for you to swallow - Drink about 34 to 51 ounces (1 to 1.5 liters) of water a day - Exercise gently after you eat, such as going for a walk - Avoid carbonated drinks, alcohol and smoking - Try to avoid lying down for 2 hours after a meal - Take a multivitamin daily Here's a brief list of foods recommended for people with gastroparesis (your dietitian can give you a more comprehensive list): - White bread and rolls and \"light\" whole-wheat bread without nuts or seeds - Plain or egg bagels - English muffins - Flour or corn tortillas - Pancakes - Puffed wheat and rice cereals - Cream of wheat or rice - White crackers - Potatoes, white or sweet (no skin) - Baked french fries - Rice - Pasta - Lean beef, veal and pork (not fried) - Chicken or turkey (no skin and not fried) - Crab, lobster, shrimp, clams, scallops, oysters - Tuna (packed in water) - Cottage cheese - Eggs - Tofu - Strained meat baby food - Baby food vegetables and fruits - Tomato sauce, paste, puree, juice - Carrots (cooked) - Beets (cooked) - Mushrooms (cooked) - Vegetable juice - Vegetable broth - Fruit juices and drinks - Applesauce - Bananas - Peaches and pears (canned) - Milk, if tolerated - Yogurt (without fruit pieces) - Custard and pudding - Frozen yogurt Medications Medications to treat gastroparesis may include: - Medications to stimulate the stomach muscles. These medications include metoclopramide (Reglan) and erythromycin (Eryc, E.E.S.). Metoclopramide has a risk of serious side effects. Erythromycin may lose its effectiveness over time, and can cause side effects, such as diarrhea. A newer medication, domperidone, with fewer side effects, is also available with restricted access. - Medications to control nausea and vomiting. Drugs that help ease nausea and vomiting include prochlorperazine (Compro) and diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Unisom). A class of medications that includes ondansetron (Zofran) is sometimes used to help nausea and vomiting. Surgical treatment Some people with gastroparesis may be unable to tolerate any food or liquids. In these situations, doctors may recommend a feeding tube (jejunostomy tube) be placed in the small intestine. Or doctors may recommend a gastric venting tube to help relieve pressure from gastric contents. Feeding tubes can be passed through your nose or mouth or directly into your small intestine through your skin. The tube is usually temporary and is only used when gastroparesis is severe or when blood sugar levels can't be controlled by any other method. Some people may require an IV (parenteral) feeding tube that goes directly into a vein in the chest. Treatments under investigation Researchers are continuing to investigate new medications to treat gastroparesis. One example is a new drug in development called relamorelin. The results of a phase 2 clinical trial found the drug could speed up gastric emptying and reduce vomiting. The drug is not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but a larger clinical trial is currently underway. A number of new therapies are being tried with the help of endoscopy - a slender tube that's threaded down the esophagus. One procedure used endoscopy to place a small tube (stent) where the stomach connects to the small intestine (duodenum) to keep this connection open. Several research trials investigated the use of botulinum toxin administered through endoscopy without much success. This treatment is not recommended. Doctors are also studying the use of a minimally invasive surgical technique when someone needs a feeding tube placed directly into the small intestine (jejunostomy tube). Gastric electrical stimulation and pacing Gastric electrical stimulation is a surgically implanted device that provides electrical stimulation to stimulate stomach muscles to move food more efficiently. Study results have been mixed. However, the device seems to be most helpful for people with diabetic gastroparesis. The FDA allows the device to be used under a compassionate use exemption for those who can't control their gastroparesis symptoms with diet changes or medications. However, larger studies are needed. Gastric pacing also involves a surgically implanted device that stimulates the stomach muscles, but this device tries to more closely mimic normal stomach contractions. Currently, the device is too large and causes discomfort. Gastric pacing devices are only available in clinical trials right now. If you're a smoker, stop. Your gastroparesis symptoms are less likely to improve over time if you keep smoking. People with gastroparesis who are overweight are also less likely to get better over time. There is some evidence that certain alternative treatments can be helpful to people with gastroparesis, although more studies are needed. Some treatments that look promising include: - Acupuncture and electroacupuncture. Acupuncture involves the insertion of extremely thin needles through your skin at strategic points on your body. During electroacupuncture, a small electrical current is passed through the needles. Studies have shown these treatments to ease gastroparesis symptoms more than a sham treatment. - STW 5 (Iberogast). This herbal formula from Germany contains nine different herbal extracts. It hasn't been shown to speed up gastric emptying, but was slightly better at easing digestive symptoms than a placebo. - Rikkunshito. This Japanese herbal formula also contains nine herbs. It may help reduce abdominal pain and the feeling of post-meal fullness. - Cannabis. There aren't any published clinical trials on cannabis and gastroparesis. However, cannabis - commonly known as marijuana - is thought to ease nausea and other digestive complaints. Derivatives of cannabis have been used by people who have cancer in the past, but there are better FDA-approved medications available to control nausea now. Because cannabis is often smoked, there's concern about possible addiction and harm, similar to what occurs with tobacco smoke. In addition, daily users of marijuana (cannabis) may develop a condition that mimics the symptoms of gastroparesis called cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Quitting cannabis may help."

Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food\u2014 sometimes several hours after a meal. Other common symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), pain in the stomach area, abdominal bloating, and lack of appetite. Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and gastric emptying tests. Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or pur\u00e9ed diet may be prescribed.

Acute gastritis caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or alcohol may be relieved by stopping use of those substances. Medications used to treat gastritis include: - Antibiotic medications to kill H. pylori. For H. pylori in your digestive tract, your doctor may recommend a combination of antibiotics, such as clarithromycin (Biaxin) and amoxicillin (Amoxil, Augmentin, others) or metronidazole (Flagyl), to kill the bacterium. Be sure to take the full antibiotic prescription, usually for seven to 14 days. - Medications that block acid production and promote healing. Proton pump inhibitors reduce acid by blocking the action of the parts of cells that produce acid. These drugs include the prescription and over-the-counter medications omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), esomeprazole (Nexium), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant) and pantoprazole (Protonix). Long-term use of proton pump inhibitors, particularly at high doses, may increase your risk of hip, wrist and spine fractures. Ask your doctor whether a calcium supplement may reduce this risk. - Medications to reduce acid production. Acid blockers - also called histamine (H-2) blockers - reduce the amount of acid released into your digestive tract, which relieves gastritis pain and encourages healing. Available by prescription or over-the-counter, acid blockers include ranitidine (Zantac), famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet HB) and nizatidine (Axid AR). - Antacids that neutralize stomach acid.

OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA     - If you have open-angle glaucoma, you will probably be given eye drops.   - You may need more than one type. Most people can be treated with eye drops.   - Most of the eye drops used today have fewer side effects than those used in the past.   - You also may be given pills to lower pressure in the eye.      If drops alone do not work, you may need other treatment:     - Laser treatment uses a painless laser to open the channels where fluid flows out.   - If drops and laser treatment do not work, you may need surgery. The doctor will open a new channel so fluid can escape. This will help lower your pressure.   - Recently, new implants have been developed that can help treat glaucoma in people having cataract surgery.     ACUTE ANGLE GLAUCOMA   An acute angle-closure attack is a medical emergency. You can become blind in a few days if you are not treated.      - You may be given drops, pills, and medicine given through a vein (by IV) to lower your eye pressure.   - Some people also need an emergency operation, called an iridotomy. The doctor uses a laser to open a new channel in the iris. Sometimes this is done with surgery. The new channel relieves the attack and will prevent another attack.   - To help prevent an attack in the other eye, the procedure will often be performed on the other eye. This may be done even if it has never had an attack.      CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA     - Congenital glaucoma is almost always treated with surgery.   - This is done using general anesthesia. This means the child is asleep and feels no pain.      SECONDARY GLAUCOMA   If you have secondary glaucoma, treating the cause may help your symptoms go away. Other treatments also may be needed."

        "document": "Glaucoma: Glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that can damage the optic nerve. This nerve sends the images you see to your brain.   Most often, optic nerve damage is caused by increased pressure in the eye. This is called intraocular pressure.           Watch this video about:    Glaucoma Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness in the United States. There are four major types of glaucoma:     - Open-angle glaucoma   - Angle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma   - Congenital glaucoma   - Secondary glaucoma      The front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is made in an area behind the colored part of the eye (iris). It leaves the eye through channels where the iris and cornea meet. This area is called the anterior chamber angle, or the angle. The cornea is the clear covering on the front of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and angle.   Anything that slows or blocks the flow of this fluid will cause pressure to build up in the eye.      - In open-angle glaucoma, the increase in pressure is often small and slow.   - In closed-angle glaucoma, the increase is often high and sudden.   - Either type can damage the optic nerve.      Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma.     - The cause is unknown. The increase in eye pressure happens slowly over time. You cannot feel it.   - The increased pressure pushes on the optic nerve. Damage to the optic nerve causes blind spots in your vision.   - Open-angle glaucoma tends to run in families. Your risk is higher if you have a parent or grandparent with open-angle glaucoma. People of African descent are also at higher risk for this disease.      Closed-angle glaucoma occurs when the fluid is suddenly blocked and cannot flow out of the eye. This causes a quick, severe rise in eye pressure.     - Dilating eye drops and certain medicines may trigger an acute glaucoma attack.   - Closed-angle glaucoma is an emergency.   - If you have had acute glaucoma in one eye, you are at risk for it in the second eye. Your health care provider is likely to treat your second eye to prevent a first attack in that eye.      Secondary glaucoma occurs due to a known cause. Both open- and closed-angle glaucoma can be secondary when caused by something known. Causes include:     - Drugs such as corticosteroids   - Eye diseases such as uveitis (an infection of the middle layer of the eye)   - Diseases such as diabetes   - Eye injury      Congenital glaucoma occurs in babies.      - It often runs in families.   - It is present at birth.   - It is caused when the eye does not develop normally. OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA     - Most people have no symptoms.   - Once vision loss occurs, the damage is already severe.   - Slow loss of side (peripheral) vision (also called tunnel vision).   - Advanced glaucoma can lead to blindness.     ANGLE-CLOSURE GLAUCOMA   Symptoms may come and go at first, or steadily become worse. You may notice:     - Sudden, severe pain in one eye   - Decreased or cloudy vision, often called \"steamy\" vision   - Nausea and vomiting   - Rainbow-like halos around lights   - Red eye   - Eye feels swollen      CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA   Symptoms are most often noticed when the child is a few months old.     - Cloudiness of the front of the eye   - Enlargement of one eye or both eyes   - Red eye   - Sensitivity to light   - Tearing      SECONDARY GLAUCOMA     - Symptoms are most often related to the underlying problem causing the glaucoma.   - Depending on the cause, symptoms may either be like open-angle glaucoma or angle-closure glaucoma. The only way to diagnose glaucoma is by having a complete eye exam.      - You will be given a test to check your eye pressure. This is called tonometry.   - In most cases, you will be given eye drops to widen (dilate) your pupil.   - When your pupil is dilated, your eye doctor will look at the inside of your eye and the optic nerve.        Eye pressure is different at different times of the day. Eye pressure can even be normal in some people with glaucoma. So you will need other tests to confirm glaucoma. They may include:     - Using a special lens to look at the angle of the eye (gonioscopy).   - Photographs or laser scanning images of the inside of your eye (optic nerve imaging).   - Checking your retina. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye.   - Checking how your pupil responds to light (pupillary reflex response).   - 3-D view of your eye (slit lamp examination).   - Testing the clearness of your vision (visual acuity).   - Testing your field of vision (visual field measurement). The goal of treatment is to reduce your eye pressure. Treatment depends on the type of glaucoma that you have.   OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA     - If you have open-angle glaucoma, you will probably be given eye drops.   - You may need more than one type. Most people can be treated with eye drops.   - Most of the eye drops used today have fewer side effects than those used in the past.   - You also may be given pills to lower pressure in the eye.      If drops alone do not work, you may need other treatment:     - Laser treatment uses a painless laser to open the channels where fluid flows out.   - If drops and laser treatment do not work, you may need surgery. The doctor will open a new channel so fluid can escape. This will help lower your pressure.   - Recently, new implants have been developed that can help treat glaucoma in people having cataract surgery.     ACUTE ANGLE GLAUCOMA   An acute angle-closure attack is a medical emergency. You can become blind in a few days if you are not treated.      - You may be given drops, pills, and medicine given through a vein (by IV) to lower your eye pressure.   - Some people also need an emergency operation, called an iridotomy. The doctor uses a laser to open a new channel in the iris. Sometimes this is done with surgery. The new channel relieves the attack and will prevent another attack.   - To help prevent an attack in the other eye, the procedure will often be performed on the other eye. This may be done even if it has never had an attack.      CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA     - Congenital glaucoma is almost always treated with surgery.   - This is done using general anesthesia. This means the child is asleep and feels no pain.      SECONDARY GLAUCOMA   If you have secondary glaucoma, treating the cause may help your symptoms go away. Other treatments also may be needed. Open-angle glaucoma cannot be cured. You can manage it and keep your sight by following your provider's directions.    Closed-angle glaucoma is a medical emergency. You need treatment right away to save your vision.   Babies with congenital glaucoma usually do well when surgery is done early.   How you do with secondary glaucoma depends on what is causing the condition. If you have severe eye pain or a sudden loss of vision, get immediate medical help. These may be signs of closed-angle glaucoma. You cannot prevent open-angle glaucoma. Most people have no symptoms. But you can help prevent vision loss.     - A complete eye exam can help find open-angle glaucoma early, when it is easier to treat.   - All adults should have a complete eye exam by the age of 40.   - If you are at risk for glaucoma, you should have a complete eye exam sooner than age 40.   - You should have regular eye exams as recommended by your provider.      If you are at risk for closed-angle glaucoma, your provider may recommend treatment before you have an attack to help prevent eye damage and vision loss. Updated by: Franklin W.

        "document": "Glaucoma (Causes): Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness in the United States. There are four major types of glaucoma:     - Open-angle glaucoma   - Angle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma   - Congenital glaucoma   - Secondary glaucoma      The front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is made in an area behind the colored part of the eye (iris). It leaves the eye through channels where the iris and cornea meet. This area is called the anterior chamber angle, or the angle. The cornea is the clear covering on the front of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and angle.   Anything that slows or blocks the flow of this fluid will cause pressure to build up in the eye.      - In open-angle glaucoma, the increase in pressure is often small and slow.   - In closed-angle glaucoma, the increase is often high and sudden.   - Either type can damage the optic nerve.      Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma.     - The cause is unknown. The increase in eye pressure happens slowly over time. You cannot feel it.   - The increased pressure pushes on the optic nerve. Damage to the optic nerve causes blind spots in your vision.   - Open-angle glaucoma tends to run in families. Your risk is higher if you have a parent or grandparent with open-angle glaucoma. People of African descent are also at higher risk for this disease.      Closed-angle glaucoma occurs when the fluid is suddenly blocked and cannot flow out of the eye. This causes a quick, severe rise in eye pressure.     - Dilating eye drops and certain medicines may trigger an acute glaucoma attack.   - Closed-angle glaucoma is an emergency.   - If you have had acute glaucoma in one eye, you are at risk for it in the second eye. Your health care provider is likely to treat your second eye to prevent a first attack in that eye.      Secondary glaucoma occurs due to a known cause. Both open- and closed-angle glaucoma can be secondary when caused by something known. Causes include:     - Drugs such as corticosteroids   - Eye diseases such as uveitis (an infection of the middle layer of the eye)   - Diseases such as diabetes   - Eye injury      Congenital glaucoma occurs in babies.      - It often runs in families.   - It is present at birth.   - It is caused when the eye does not develop normally."

        "document": "Female pattern baldness (Treatment): Untreated, hair loss in female pattern baldness is permanent. In most cases, hair loss is mild to moderate. You do not need treatment if you are comfortable with your appearance.   MEDICINES   The only medicine approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat female pattern baldness is minoxidil:     - It is applied to the scalp.   - For women, the 2% solution or 5% foam is recommended.   - Minoxidil may help hair grow in about 1 in 4 or 5 of women. In most women, it may slow or stop hair loss.   - You must continue to use this medicine for a long time. Hair loss starts again when you stop using it. Also, the hair that it helps grow will fall out.     If minoxidil does not work, your provider may recommend other medicines, such as spironolactone, cimetidine, birth control pills, ketoconazole, among others. Your provider can tell you more about these if needed.    HAIR TRANSPLANT   During hair transplant, tiny plugs of hair are removed from areas where hair is thicker, and placed (transplanted) in areas that are balding. Minor scarring may occur where hair is removed. There is a slight risk of skin infection. You will likely need many transplants, which can be expensive. However, the results are often excellent and permanent.   OTHER SOLUTIONS   Hair weaving, hairpieces, or a change in hairstyle can help hide hair loss and improve your appearance.

        "document": "Hair loss (Treatment): Effective treatments for some types of hair loss are available. But some hair loss is permanent. With some conditions, such as patchy alopecia, hair may regrow without treatment within a year. Treatments for hair loss include medications, surgery, laser therapy, and wigs or hairpieces. Your doctor may suggest a combination of these approaches in order to get the best results. The goals of treatment are to promote hair growth, slow hair loss or hide hair loss. Medication If your hair loss is caused by an underlying disease, treatment for that disease will be necessary. This may include drugs to reduce inflammation and suppress your immune system, such as prednisone. If a certain medication is causing the hair loss, your doctor may advise you to stop using it for at least three months. Medications are available to treat pattern baldness. Two medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hair loss are: - Minoxidil (Rogaine). Minoxidil is an over-the-counter liquid or foam that you rub into your scalp twice a day to grow hair and to prevent further hair loss. It may be used by men and women. With this treatment, some people experience hair regrowth, a slower rate of hair loss or both. The effect peaks at 16 weeks and you need to keep applying the medication to retain benefits. Possible side effects include scalp irritation, unwanted hair growth on the adjacent skin of the face and hands, and rapid heart rate (tachycardia). - Finasteride (Propecia). This prescription drug is available only to men. It's taken daily in pill form. Many men taking finasteride experience a slowing of hair loss, and some may show some new hair growth. You need to keep taking it to retain benefits. Rare side effects of finasteride include diminished sex drive and sexual function and an increased risk of prostate cancer. Women who are or may be pregnant need to avoid touching crushed or broken tablets. Surgery In the most common type of permanent hair loss, only the top of the head is affected. Hair transplant or restoration surgery can make the most of the hair you have left. During this procedure, your surgeon removes tiny plugs of skin, each containing a few hairs, from the back or sides of your scalp. He or she then implants the plugs into the bald sections of your scalp. You may be asked to take a hair loss medication before and after surgery to improve results. Surgical procedures to treat baldness are expensive and can be painful. Possible risks include infection and scarring. Wigs and hairpieces You may want to try a wig or a hairpiece as an alternative to medical treatment or if you don't respond to treatment. It can be used to cover either permanent or temporary hair loss. Quality, natural-looking wigs and hairpieces are available. If your hair loss is due to a medical condition, the cost of a wig may be covered by insurance. You'll need a prescription for the wig from your doctor."

        "query": "Hello,   I have a scoliosis problem plz help me I want its treatment I can send my x.ray also",
        "document": "Scoliosis: Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that occurs most often during the growth spurt just before puberty. While scoliosis can be caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, the cause of most scoliosis is unknown. Most cases of scoliosis are mild, but some children develop spine deformities that continue to get more severe as they grow. Severe scoliosis can be disabling. An especially severe spinal curve can reduce the amount of space within the chest, making it difficult for the lungs to function properly. Children who have mild scoliosis are monitored closely, usually with X-rays, to see if the curve is getting worse. In many cases, no treatment is necessary. Some children will need to wear a brace to stop the curve from worsening. Others may need surgery to keep the scoliosis from worsening and to straighten severe cases of scoliosis. Signs and symptoms of scoliosis may include: - Uneven shoulders   - One shoulder blade that appears more prominent than the other   - Uneven waist   - One hip higher than the other If a scoliosis curve gets worse, the spine will also rotate or twist, in addition to curving side to side. This causes the ribs on one side of the body to stick out farther than on the other side. When to see a doctor Go to your doctor if you notice signs or symptoms of scoliosis in your child. Mild curves, however, can develop without the parent or child knowing it because they appear gradually and usually don't cause pain. Occasionally, teachers, friends and sports teammates are the first to notice a child's scoliosis. Doctors don't know what causes the most common type of scoliosis - although it appears to involve hereditary factors, because the disorder tends to run in families. Less common types of scoliosis may be caused by: - Neuromuscular conditions, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy   - Birth defects affecting the development of the bones of the spine   - Injuries to or infections of the spine Risk factors for developing the most common type of scoliosis include: - Age. Signs and symptoms typically begin during the growth spurt that occurs just prior to puberty.   - Sex. Although both boys and girls develop mild scoliosis at about the same rate, girls have a much higher risk of the curve worsening and requiring treatment.   - Family history. Scoliosis can run in families, but most children with scoliosis don't have a family history of the disease. The doctor will initially take a detailed medical history and may ask questions about recent growth. During the physical exam, your doctor may have your child stand and then bend forward from the waist, with arms hanging loosely, to see if one side of the rib cage is more prominent than the other. Your doctor may also perform a neurological exam to check for: - Muscle weakness - Numbness - Abnormal reflexes Imaging tests Plain X-rays can confirm the diagnosis of scoliosis and reveal the severity of the spinal curvature. If a doctor suspects that an underlying condition - such as a tumor - is causing the scoliosis, he or she may recommend additional imaging tests, such as an MRI. Most children with scoliosis have mild curves and probably won't need treatment with a brace or surgery. Children who have mild scoliosis may need checkups every four to six months to see if there have been changes in the curvature of their spines. While there are guidelines for mild, moderate and severe curves, the decision to begin treatment is always made on an individual basis. Factors to be considered include: - Sex. Girls have a much higher risk of progression than do boys. - Severity of curve. Larger curves are more likely to worsen with time. - Curve pattern. Double curves, also known as S-shaped curves, tend to worsen more often than do C-shaped curves. - Location of curve. Curves located in the center (thoracic) section of the spine worsen more often than do curves in the upper or lower sections of the spine. - Maturity. If a child's bones have stopped growing, the risk of curve progression is low. That also means that braces have the most effect in children whose bones are still growing. Braces If your child's bones are still growing and he or she has moderate scoliosis, your doctor may recommend a brace. Wearing a brace won't cure scoliosis or reverse the curve, but it usually prevents further progression of the curve. The most common type of brace is made of plastic and is contoured to conform to the body. This close-fitting brace is almost invisible under the clothes, as it fits under the arms and around the rib cage, lower back and hips. Most braces are worn day and night. A brace's effectiveness increases with the number of hours a day it's worn. Children who wear braces can usually participate in most activities and have few restrictions. If necessary, kids can take off the brace to participate in sports or other physical activities. Braces are discontinued after the bones stop growing. This typically occurs: - About two years after girls begin to menstruate - When boys need to shave daily - When there are no further changes in height Surgery Severe scoliosis typically progresses with time, so your doctor might suggest scoliosis surgery to reduce the severity of the spinal curve and to prevent it from getting worse. The most common type of scoliosis surgery is called spinal fusion. In spinal fusion, surgeons connect two or more of the bones in the spine (vertebrae) together, so they can't move independently. Pieces of bone or a bone-like material are placed between the vertebrae. Metal rods, hooks, screws or wires typically hold that part of the spine straight and still while the old and new bone material fuses together. If the scoliosis is progressing rapidly at a young age, surgeons can install a rod that can adjust in length as the child grows. This growing rod is attached to the top and bottom sections of the spinal curvature, and is usually lengthened every six months. Complications of spinal surgery may include bleeding, infection, pain or nerve damage. Rarely, the bone fails to heal and another surgery may be needed. Although physical therapy exercises can't stop scoliosis, general exercise or participating in sports may have the benefit of improving overall health and well-being. Studies indicate that the following treatments for scoliosis are ineffective: - Chiropractic manipulation - Electrical stimulation of muscles - Dietary supplements"

        "document": "Scoliosis: Scoliosis is an abnormal curving of the spine. Your spine is your backbone. It runs straight down your back. Everyone's spine naturally curves a bit. But people with scoliosis have a spine that curves too much. The spine might look like the letter C or S. Most of the time, the cause of scoliosis is unknown. This is called idiopathic scoliosis. It is the most common type. It is grouped by age.     - In children age 3 and younger, it is called infantile scoliosis.   - In children age 4 through 10, it is called juvenile scoliosis.   - In children age 11 through 18, it is called adolescent scoliosis.     Scoliosis most often affects girls. Some people are more likely to have curving of the spine. Curving generally gets worse during a growth spurt.   Other types of scoliosis are:     - Congenital scoliosis: This type of scoliosis is present at birth. It occurs when the baby\u2019s ribs or spine bones do not form properly.   - Neuromuscular scoliosis: This type is caused by a nervous system problem that affects\u00a0the muscles. Problems can include cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, and polio. Most often,\u00a0there are no symptoms.     If there are symptoms, they may include:     - Backache or low-back pain   - Tired feeling in the spine after sitting or standing for a long time   - Uneven hips or shoulders (one shoulder may be higher than the other)   - Spine curves more to one side The health care provider will perform a physical exam. You will be asked to bend forward. This makes your spine easier to see. It may be hard to see changes in the early stages of scoliosis.     The exam may show:     - One shoulder is higher than the other   - The pelvis is tilted     X-rays of the spine are done. X-rays are important because the actual curving of the spine may be worse than what your doctor can see during an exam.   Other tests may include:     - Spinal curve measurement (scoliometer screening)   - MRI of the spine Treatment depends on many things:     - The cause of scoliosis   - Where the curve is in your spine   - How big the curve is   - If your body is still growing     Most people with idiopathic scoliosis do not need treatment. But you should still be checked by a doctor about every 6 months.     If you are still growing, your doctor might recommend a back brace. A back brace prevents further curving. There are many different types of braces. What kind you get depends on the size and location of your curve. Your provider will pick the best one for you and show you how to use it. Back braces can be adjusted as you grow.   Back braces work best in people over age 10. Braces do not work for those with congenital or neuromuscular scoliosis.     You may need surgery if the spine curve is severe or getting worse very quickly.   Surgery involves correcting the curve as much as possible:     - Surgery is done with a cut through the back, belly area, or beneath the ribs.   - The spine bones are held in place with 1 or 2 metal rods. The rods are held down with hooks and screws until the bone heals together.   - After surgery, you may need to wear a brace for a while to keep the spine still.     Scoliosis treatment may also include:     - Emotional support: Some children, especially teens, may be self-conscious when using a back brace.   - Physical therapy and other specialists to help explain the treatments and make sure the brace fits correctly. Seek support and more information from organizations that specialize in scoliosis. How well a person with scoliosis does depends on the type, cause, and severity of the curve. The more severe the curving, the more likely it will get worse after the child stops growing.   People with mild scoliosis do well with braces. They usually do not have long-term problems. Back pain may be more likely when the person gets older.   Outlook for those with neuromuscular or congenital scoliosis varies. They may have another serious disorder, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy, so their goals are much different. Often, the goal of surgery is simply to allow a child to be able to sit upright in a wheelchair.   Congenital scoliosis is difficult to treat and usually requires many surgeries. Complications of scoliosis can include:     - Breathing problems (in severe scoliosis)   - Low back pain   - Lower self-esteem   - Persistent pain if there is wear and tear of the spine bones   - Spinal infection after surgery   - Spine or nerve damage from an uncorrected curve or spinal surgery Call your provider if you suspect your child may have scoliosis. Routine scoliosis screening is now done in middle schools.   Such screening has helped detect early scoliosis in many children. Updated by: Neil K.

If the curve is moderate and you are still growing, your doctor may recommend a brace to keep the curve from getting worse. Braces are selected for the specific curve problem and fitted to each patient. Braces must be worn every day for the full number of hours prescribed by the doctor. - Surgery. If you are still growing and have a severe curve that is getting worse, your doctor may suggest surgery. This often involves fusing together two or more bones in the spine. The doctor may also put in a metal rod or other device to help keep the spine straight after surgery. You should seek the advice of at least two experts, and ask about the benefits and risks of the surgery. The following treatments have not been shown to keep curves from getting worse in scoliosis: - Chiropractic treatment. - Electrical stimulation. - Nutritional supplements."

        "document": "Scoliosis (Outlook (Prognosis)): How well a person with scoliosis does depends on the type, cause, and severity of the curve. The more severe the curving, the more likely it will get worse after the child stops growing.   People with mild scoliosis do well with braces. They usually do not have long-term problems. Back pain may be more likely when the person gets older.   Outlook for those with neuromuscular or congenital scoliosis varies. They may have another serious disorder, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy, so their goals are much different. Often, the goal of surgery is simply to allow a child to be able to sit upright in a wheelchair.   Congenital scoliosis is difficult to treat and usually requires many surgeries."

But you should still be checked by a doctor about every 6 months.     If you are still growing, your doctor might recommend a back brace. A back brace prevents further curving. There are many different types of braces. What kind you get depends on the size and location of your curve. Your provider will pick the best one for you and show you how to use it. Back braces can be adjusted as you grow.   Back braces work best in people over age 10. Braces do not work for those with congenital or neuromuscular scoliosis.     You may need surgery if the spine curve is severe or getting worse very quickly.   Surgery involves correcting the curve as much as possible:     - Surgery is done with a cut through the back, belly area, or beneath the ribs.   - The spine bones are held in place with 1 or 2 metal rods. The rods are held down with hooks and screws until the bone heals together.   - After surgery, you may need to wear a brace for a while to keep the spine still.     Scoliosis treatment may also include:     - Emotional support: Some children, especially teens, may be self-conscious when using a back brace.   - Physical therapy and other specialists to help explain the treatments and make sure the brace fits correctly."

        "document": "Childhood obesity (Treatment): Treatment for childhood obesity is based on your child's age and if he or she has other medical conditions. Treatment usually includes changes in your child's eating habits and physical activity level. In certain circumstances, treatment might include medications or weight-loss surgery. Treatment for children who are overweight The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children older than 2 and adolescents whose weight falls in the overweight category be put on a weight-maintenance program to slow the progress of weight gain. This strategy allows the child to add inches in height but not pounds, causing BMI to drop over time into a healthier range. Treatment for children who are obese Children ages 6 to 11 who are obese might be encouraged to modify their eating habits for gradual weight loss of no more than 1 pound (or about 0.5 kilogram) a month. Older children and adolescents who are obese or severely obese might be encouraged to modify their eating habits to aim for weight loss of up to 2 pounds (or about 1 kilogram) a week. The methods for maintaining your child's current weight or losing weight are the same: Your child needs to eat a healthy diet - both in terms of type and amount of food - and increase physical activity. Success depends largely on your commitment to helping your child make these changes. Healthy eating Parents are the ones who buy groceries, cook meals and decide where the food is eaten. Even small changes can make a big difference in your child's health. - When food shopping, choose fruits and vegetables. Cut back on convenience foods - such as cookies, crackers and prepared meals - which are often high in sugar, fat and calories. Always have healthy snacks available. - Limit sweetened beverages. This includes those that contain fruit juice. These drinks provide little nutritional value in exchange for their high calories. They also can make your child feel too full to eat healthier foods. - Limit fast food. Many of the menu options are high in fat and calories. - Sit down together for family meals. Make it an event - a time to share news and tell stories. Discourage eating in front of a TV, computer or video game screen, which can lead to fast eating and lowered awareness of amount eaten. - Serve appropriate portion sizes. Children don't need as much food as adults do. Allow your child to eat until he or she is full, even if that means leaving food on the plate. And remember, when you eat out, restaurant portion sizes are often significantly oversized. Physical activity A critical part of achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, especially for children, is physical activity. It burns calories, strengthens bones and muscles, and helps children sleep well at night and stay alert during the day. Good habits established in childhood help adolescents maintain healthy weights despite the hormonal changes, rapid growth and social influences that often lead to overeating. And active children are more likely to become fit adults. To increase your child's activity level: - Limit TV and recreational computer time. Time spent watching television or using computers, smartphones or tablets is known as screen time. Children younger than 18 months should avoid all screen time, except for video-chatting with family and friends. For older preschooolers, limit screen use to 1 hour per day of high-quality programming. - Emphasize activity, not exercise. Children should be moderately to vigorously active for at least an hour a day. Your child's activity doesn't have to be a structured exercise program - the object is to get him or her moving. Free-play activities - such as playing hide-and-seek, tag or jump-rope - can be great for burning calories and improving fitness. - Find activities your child likes. For instance, if your child is artistically inclined, go on a nature hike to collect leaves and rocks that your child can use to make a collage. If your child likes to climb, head for the nearest neighborhood jungle gym or climbing wall. If your child likes to read, then walk or bike to the neighborhood library for a book. Medications Medication might be prescribed for some adolescents as part of an overall weight-loss plan. The risks of taking a prescription medication over the long term are unknown, and the medication's effect on weight loss and weight maintenance for adolescents is still in question. Weight-loss surgery Weight-loss surgery may be an option for severely obese adolescents who have been unable to lose weight through lifestyle changes. However, as with any type of surgery, there are potential risks and long-term complications. Also, the long-term effects of weight-loss surgery on future growth and development are largely unknown. Weight-loss surgery in adolescents is uncommon. But your doctor might recommend this surgery if your child's weight poses a greater health threat than do the potential risks of surgery. It's important that a child being considered for weight-loss surgery meet with a team of pediatric specialists, including a pediatric endocrinologist, psychologist and dietitian. Weight-loss surgery isn't a miracle cure. It doesn't guarantee that an adolescent will lose all of his or her excess weight or be able to keep it off long term. And surgery doesn't replace the need for a healthy diet and regular physical activity."

        "document": "Overweight and Obesity (Treatment): Treatment for overweight and obesity depends on the cause and severity of your condition. Possible treatments include healthy lifestyle changes, behavioral weight-loss treatment programs, medicines, and possibly surgery. You may need treatments for any complications that you have. Healthy lifestyle changes To help you aim for and maintain a healthy weight, your doctor may recommend that you adopt lifelong healthy lifestyle changes. Heart-healthy eating. Learn about which foods and nutrients are part of a healthy eating pattern. It\u2019s important to eat the right amount of calories to maintain a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, try to reduce your total daily calories gradually. Use the Body Weight Planner to find out your daily calorie needs and to set goals. Visit healthy recipes and plan for success. Talk with your doctor before beginning any diet or eating plan. Visit Chose My Plate or 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans for more information. Physical activity. Many health benefits are associated with physical activity and getting the recommended amount of physical activity needed each week. Physical activity is an important factor in determining whether a person can maintain a healthy body weight, lose excess body weight, or maintain successful weight loss. Before starting any exercise program, ask your doctor about what level of physical activity is right for you. Visit Physical Activity Has Many Health Benefits for more information. Healthy Sleep. Studies have shown some relationship between lack of sleep and obesity. Read Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency more information. Making lifelong healthy lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating and physical activity, can help you modify your energy balance to help you aim for and maintain a healthy weight. For example: To aim for a healthy weight, or lose weight, you want your energy OUT to be more than your energy IN. To maintain weight loss you want your energy IN and energy OUT to be the same.\u00a0 Behavioral weight-loss programs Your doctor may recommend you enroll in individual or group behavioral weight-loss programs to treat your overweight and obesity. In these programs, a trained healthcare professional will customize a weight-loss plan for you. This plan will include a moderately-reduced calorie diet, physical activity goals, and behavioral strategies to help you make and maintain these lifestyle changes. Read Living With\u00a0for more information about required follow-up for these behavioral treatment programs. Read more Did you know your brain\u2019s pleasure and reward centers can be stimulated by food and the act of eating, making it harder to change eating patterns and lose weight? Researchers know that our brains can become patterned so that we feel pleasure or reward from eating. This can make us unconsciously crave food so our bodies feel that sense of pleasure. It can also make it hard to change our eating patterns, lose weight, or maintain a healthy weight. Researchers are studying whether cognitive behavioral therapies can be an effective treatment for overweight and obesity by retraining the brain to not associate pleasure with food and the act of eating. Medicines When healthy lifestyle changes are not enough, your doctor may treat your overweight and obesity with FDA-approved medicines. These medicines work in the following parts of your body. Brain. Several medicines change the way the brain regulates the urge to eat, which can help to decrease appetite. Some examples of these medicines are diethylpropion, phendimetrazine, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide. Gastrointestinal tract. Orlistat is the only available medicine. It blocks your intestines from absorbing fat from foods in your diet. Weight loss medicines are not recommended as a single treatment for weight loss. These medicines can help you lose weight but when combined with lifestyle changes may result in greater weight loss. Some of these medicines should not be used if you have certain conditions or are taking certain medicines. Also, these medicines have side effects. Talk to your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant, breast feeding, or have a family history of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack, or stroke. Surgical procedures Some patients with obesity do not respond to healthy lifestyle changes and medicines. When these patients develop certain obesity-related complications, they may be eligible for the following surgeries. Gastric bypass surgery. A small part of the stomach is connected to the middle part of the intestine, bypassing the first part of intestine. This decreases the amount of food that you can eat and the amount of fat your body can take in and store. Gastrectomy. A big portion of the stomach is removed to decrease the amount of food that you can eat. Gastric banding. A hollow band is placed around the upper part of the stomach creating a smaller stomach. This decreases the amount of food you can eat. Talk to your doctor to learn more about the benefits and risks of each type of surgery. Possible complications include bleeding, infection, internal rupture of sutures, or even death. Read gastric bypass surgery for more information. Read more Interested in learning why these surgeries lead to weight loss in some patients? First, these surgeries reduce the amount of food stored in the stomach and the amount of calories your body can take in. This can help your body restore energy balance. Second, these surgeries change the levels of certain hormones and the way the brain responds to these hormones to control hunger urges. After surgery, some people are less interested in eating or they prefer to eat healthier foods. In some cases, genetic differences may affect how much weight loss patients experience after bariatric surgery.

        "document": "Obesity (Treatment): CHANGING YOUR LIFESTYLE    An active lifestyle and plenty of exercise, along with healthy eating, is the safest way to lose weight. Even modest weight loss can improve your health. You may need a lot of support from family and friends.   Your main goal should be to learn new, healthy ways of eating and make them part of your daily routine.   Many people find it hard to change their eating habits and behaviors. You may have practiced some habits for so long that you may not even know they are unhealthy, or you do them without thinking. You need to be motivated to make lifestyle changes. Make the behavior change part of your life over the long term. Know that it takes time to make and keep a change in your lifestyle.   Work with your provider and dietitian to set realistic, safe daily calorie counts that help you lose weight while staying healthy. Remember that if you drop pounds slowly and steadily, you are more likely to keep them off. Your dietitian can teach you about:     - Healthy food choices   - Healthy snacks   - Reading nutrition labels   - New ways to prepare food   - Portion sizes   - Sweetened drinks      Extreme diets (fewer than 1100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well. These types of diets often DO NOT contain enough vitamins and minerals. Most people who lose weight this way return to overeating and become obese again.   Learn ways to manage stress other than snacking. Examples may be meditation, yoga, or exercise. If you are depressed or stressed a lot, talk to your provider.    MEDICINES AND HERBAL REMEDIES    You may see ads for supplements and herbal remedies that claim they will help you lose weight. Some of these claims may not be true. And some of these supplements can have serious side effects. Talk to your provider before using them.   You can discuss weight loss medicines with your doctor. Many people lose at least 5 pounds (2 kg) by taking these drugs, but they may regain the weight when they stop taking the medicine unless they have made lifestyle changes.   SURGERY    Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery can reduce the risk of certain diseases in people with severe obesity. These risks include:     - Arthritis   - Diabetes   - Heart disease   - High blood pressure   - Sleep apnea   - Some cancers   - Stroke      Surgery may help people who have been very obese for 5 years or more and have not lost weight from other treatments, such as diet, exercise, or medicine.   Surgery alone is not the answer for weight loss. It can train you to eat less, but you still have to do much of the work. You must be committed to diet and exercise after surgery. Talk to your doctor to learn if surgery is a good option for you.   Weight-loss surgeries include:     - Laparoscopic gastric banding   - Gastric bypass surgery   - Sleeve gastrectomy (less common)   - Duodenal switch"

        "document": "Obesity (Treatment): The goal of obesity treatment is to reach and stay at a healthy weight. You may need to work with a team of health professionals - including a dietitian, behavior counselor or an obesity specialist - to help you understand and make changes in your eating and activity habits. The initial treatment goal is usually a modest weight loss - 3 to 5 percent of your total weight. That means that if you weigh 200 pounds (91 kg) and are obese by BMI standards, you would need to lose only about 6 to 10 pounds (2.7 to 4.5 kg) for your health to begin to improve. However, the more weight you lose, the greater the benefits. All weight-loss programs require changes in your eating habits and increased physical activity. The treatment methods that are right for you depend on your level of obesity, your overall health and your willingness to participate in your weight-loss plan. Other treatment tools include: - Dietary changes - Exercise and activity - Behavior change - Prescription weight-loss medications - Weight-loss surgery Dietary changes Reducing calories and practicing healthier eating habits are vital to overcoming obesity. Although you may lose weight quickly at first, slow and steady weight loss over the long term is considered the safest way to lose weight and the best way to keep it off permanently. Avoid drastic and unrealistic diet changes, such as crash diets, because they're unlikely to help you keep excess weight off for the long term. Plan to participate in a comprehensive weight-loss program for at least six months and in the maintenance phase of a program for at least a year to boost your odds of weight-loss success. There is no best weight-loss diet. Choose one that includes healthy foods that you feel will work for you. Dietary changes to treat obesity include: - Cutting calories. The key to weight loss is reducing how many calories you take in. You and your health care providers can review your typical eating and drinking habits to see how many calories you normally consume and where you can cut back. You and your doctor can decide how many calories you need to take in each day to lose weight, but a typical amount is 1,200 to 1,500 calories for women and 1,500 to 1,800 for men. - Feeling full on less. The concept of energy density can help you satisfy your hunger with fewer calories. All foods have a certain number of calories within a given amount (volume). Some foods - such as desserts, candies, fats and processed foods - are high in energy density. This means that a small volume of that food has a large number of calories. In contrast, other foods, such as fruits and vegetables, have lower energy density. These foods provide a larger portion size with a fewer number of calories. By eating larger portions of foods that have fewer calories, you reduce hunger pangs, take in fewer calories and feel better about your meal, which contributes to how satisfied you feel overall. - Making healthier choices. To make your overall diet healthier, eat more plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole-grain carbohydrates. Also emphasize lean sources of protein - such as beans, lentils and soy - and lean meats. If you like fish, try to include fish twice a week. Limit salt and added sugar. Stick with low-fat dairy products. Eat small amounts of fats, and make sure they come from heart-healthy sources, such as olive, canola and nut oils. - Restricting certain foods. Certain diets limit the amount of a particular food group, such as high-carbohydrate or full-fat foods. Ask your doctor which diet plans have been found effective and which might be helpful for you. Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is a sure way to consume more calories than you intended, and limiting these drinks or eliminating them altogether is a good place to start cutting calories. - Meal replacements. These plans suggest that you replace one or two meals with their products - such as low-calorie shakes or meal bars - and eat healthy snacks and a healthy, balanced third meal that's low in fat and calories. In the short term, this type of diet can help you lose weight. Keep in mind that these diets likely won't teach you how to change your overall lifestyle, though, so you may have to keep this up if you want to keep your weight off. Be wary of quick fixes. You may be tempted by fad diets that promise fast and easy weight loss. The reality, however, is that there are no magic foods or quick fixes. Fad diets may help in the short term, but the long-term results don't appear to be any better than other diets. Similarly, you may lose weight on a crash diet, but you're likely to regain it when you stop the diet. To lose weight - and keep it off - you have to adopt healthy-eating habits that you can maintain over time. Exercise and activity Increased physical activity or exercise is an essential part of obesity treatment. Most people who are able to maintain their weight loss for more than a year get regular exercise, even simply walking. To boost your activity level: - Exercise. People who are overweight or obese need to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity to prevent further weight gain or to maintain the loss of a modest amount of weight. To achieve more-significant weight loss, you may need to exercise 300 minutes or more a week. You probably will need to gradually increase the amount you exercise as your endurance and fitness improve. - Keep moving. Even though regular aerobic exercise is the most efficient way to burn calories and shed excess weight, any extra movement helps burn calories. Making simple changes throughout your day can add up to big benefits. Park farther from store entrances, rev up your household chores, garden, get up and move around periodically, and wear a pedometer to track how many steps you actually take over the course of a day. Behavior changes A behavior modification program can help you make lifestyle changes and lose weight and keep it off. Steps to take include examining your current habits to find out what factors, stresses or situations may have contributed to your obesity. Everyone is different and has different obstacles to managing weight, such as a lack of time to exercise or late-night eating. Tailor your behavior changes to address your individual concerns. Behavior modification, sometimes called behavior therapy, can include: - Counseling. Therapy or interventions with trained mental health or other professionals can help you address emotional and behavioral issues related to eating. Therapy can help you understand why you overeat and learn healthy ways to cope with anxiety. You can also learn how to monitor your diet and activity, understand eating triggers, and cope with food cravings. Therapy can take place on both an individual and group basis. More-intensive programs - those that include 12 to 26 sessions a year - may be more helpful in achieving your weight-loss goals. - Support groups. You can find camaraderie and understanding in support groups where others share similar challenges with obesity. Check with your doctor, local hospitals or commercial weight-loss programs for support groups in your area, such as Weight Watchers. Prescription weight-loss medication Losing weight requires a healthy diet and regular exercise. But in certain situations, prescription weight-loss medication may help. Keep in mind, though, that weight-loss medication is meant to be used along with diet, exercise and behavior changes, not instead of them. If you don't make these other changes in your life, medication is unlikely to work. Your doctor may recommend weight-loss medication if other methods of weight loss haven't worked for you and you meet one of the following criteria: - Your body mass index (BMI) is 30 or greater - Your BMI is greater than 27, and you also have medical complications of obesity, such as diabetes, high blood pressure or sleep apnea Before selecting a medication for you, your doctor will consider your health history, as well as possible side effects. Some weight-loss medications can't be used by women who are pregnant, or people who take certain medications or have chronic health conditions. Commonly prescribed weight-loss medications include orlistat (Xenical), lorcaserin (Belviq), phentermine and topiramate (Qsymia), buproprion and naltrexone (Contrave), and liraglutide (Saxenda). You will need close medical monitoring while taking a prescription weight-loss medication. Also, keep in mind that a weight-loss medication may not work for everyone, and the effects may wane over time. When you stop taking a weight-loss medication, you may regain much or all of the weight you lost. Weight-loss surgery In some cases, weight-loss surgery, also called bariatric surgery, is an option. Weight-loss surgery limits the amount of food you're able to comfortably eat or decreases the absorption of food and calories or both. While weight-loss surgery offers the best chance of losing the most weight, it can pose serious risks. Weight-loss surgery for obesity may be considered if you have tried other methods to lose weight that haven't worked and: - You have extreme obesity (BMI of 40 or higher) - Your BMI is 35 to 39.9, and you also have a serious weight-related health problem, such as diabetes or high blood pressure - You're committed to making the lifestyle changes that are necessary for surgery to work It doesn't guarantee that you'll lose all of your excess weight or that you'll keep it off long term. Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits. It doesn't guarantee that you'll lose all of your excess weight or that you'll keep it off long term. Weight-loss success after surgery depends on your commitment to making lifelong changes in your eating and exercise habits. Common weight-loss surgeries include: - Gastric bypass surgery. In gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), the surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of your stomach. The small intestine is then cut a short distance below the main stomach and connected to the new pouch. Food and liquid flow directly from the pouch into this part of the intestine, bypassing most of your stomach. - Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). In this procedure, your stomach is separated into two pouches with an inflatable band. Pulling the band tight, like a belt, the surgeon creates a tiny channel between the two pouches. The band keeps the opening from expanding and is generally designed to stay in place permanently. - Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. This procedure begins with the surgeon removing a large part of the stomach. The surgeon leaves the valve that releases food to the small intestine and the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). Then the surgeon closes off the middle section of the intestine and attaches the last part directly to the duodenum. The separated section of the intestine is reattached to the end of the intestine to allow bile and digestive juices to flow into this part of the intestine. - Gastric sleeve. In this procedure, part of the stomach is removed, creating a smaller reservoir for food. It's a less complicated surgery than gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. Other treatments Vagal nerve blockade is another treatment for obesity. It involves implanting a device under the skin of the abdomen that sends intermittent electrical pulses to the abdominal vagus nerve, which tells the brain when the stomach feels empty or full. This new technology received FDA approval in 2014 for use by adults who have not been able to lose weight with a weight-loss program and who have a BMI of 35 to 45 with at least one obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes. Preventing weight regain after obesity treatment Unfortunately, it's common to regain weight no matter what obesity treatment methods you try. If you take weight-loss medications, you'll probably regain weight when you stop taking them. You might even regain weight after weight-loss surgery if you continue to overeat or overindulge in high-calorie foods. But that doesn't mean your weight-loss efforts are futile. One of the best ways to prevent regaining the weight you've lost is to get regular physical activity. Aim for 60 minutes a day. Keep track of your physical activity if it helps you stay motivated and on course. As you lose weight and gain better health, talk to your doctor about what additional activities you might be able to do and, if appropriate, how to give your activity and exercise a boost. You may always have to remain vigilant about your weight. Combining a healthier diet and more activity in a practical and sustainable manner are the best ways to keep the weight you lost off for the long term. Take your weight loss and weight maintenance one day at a time and surround yourself with supportive resources to help ensure your success. Find a healthier way of living that you can stick with for the long term."

        "document": "Prescription Medications to Treat Overweight and Obesity: Health care providers use the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a measure of your weight in relation to your height, to define overweight and obesity. People who have a BMI between 25 and 30 are considered overweight. Obesity is defined as having a BMI of 30 or greater. You can calculate your BMI to learn if you are overweight or obese. Being overweight or obese may increase the risk of health problems. Your health care provider can assess your individual risk due to your weight.Obesity is a chronic condition that affects more than one in three adults in the United States. Another one in three adults is overweight. If you are struggling with your weight, you may find that a healthy eating plan and regular physical activity help you lose weight and keep it off over the long term. If these lifestyle changes are not enough to help you lose weight or maintain your weight loss, your doctor may prescribe medications as part of your weight-control program. Prescription medications to treat overweight and obesity work in different ways. For example, some medications may help you feel less hungry or full sooner. Other medications may make it harder for your body to absorb fat from the foods you eat. Weight-loss medications are meant to help people who may have health problems related to overweight or obesity.

On average, people who take prescription medications as part of a lifestyle program lose between 3 and 9 percent more of their starting body weight than people in a lifestyle program who do not take medication. Research shows that some people taking prescription weight-loss medications lose 10 percent or more of their starting weight.1 Results vary by medication and by person.Weight loss of 5 to 10 percent of your starting body weight may help improve your health by lowering blood sugar, blood pressure, and triglycerides. Losing weight also can improve some other health problems related to overweight and obesity, such as joint pain or sleep apnea. Most weight loss takes place within the first 6 months of starting the medication. Experts are concerned that, in some cases, the side effects of prescription medications to treat overweight and obesity may outweigh the benefits. For this reason, you should never take a weight-loss medication only to improve the way you look. In the past, some weight-loss medications were linked to serious health problems. For example, the FDA recalled fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine (part of the \u201cfen-phen\u201d combination) in 1997 because of concerns related to heart valve problems.Possible side effects vary by medication and how it acts on your body. Most side effects are mild and most often improve if you continue to take the medication. Rarely, serious side effects can occur.Tips for Taking Weight-loss MedicationFollow your doctor's instructions about weight-loss medications. Buy your medication from a pharmacy or web distributor approved by your doctor. Take weight-loss medication to support your healthy eating and physical activity program. Know the side effects and warnings for taking any medication. Ask your doctor if you should stop taking your medication if you are not losing weight after 12 weeks. Discuss other medications, including supplements and vitamins, you are taking with your doctor when considering weight-loss medications. Avoid taking weight-loss medications during pregnancy or if you are planning a pregnancy. Choosing a medication to treat overweight or obesity is a decision between you and your doctor. Important factors to consider includethe likely benefits of weight loss the medication\u2019s possible side effects your current health issues and other medications your family\u2019s medical history costTalk with your doctor about which weight-loss medication might be right for you. How long you will need to take weight-loss medication depends on whether the drug helps you lose and maintain weight and whether you have any side effects. If you have lost enough weight to improve your health and are not having serious side effects, your doctor may advise that you stay on the medication indefinitely. If you do not lose at least 5 percent of your starting weight after 12 weeks on the full dose of your medication, your doctor will probably advise you to stop taking it. He or she may change your treatment plan or consider using a different weight-loss medication. Your doctor also may have you try different lifestyle, physical activity, or eating programs; change your other medications that cause weight gain; or refer you to a bariatric surgeon to see if weight-loss surgery might be an option for you.Because obesity is a chronic condition, you may need to continue changes to your eating and physical activity habits and other behaviors for years\u2014or even a lifetime\u2014to improve your health and maintain a healthy weight. You will probably regain some weight after you stop taking weight-loss medication. Developing and maintaining healthy eating habits and increasing physical activity may help you regain less weight or keep it off. Federal physical activity guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week for adults\u2014that\u2019s about 30 minutes a day most days of the week. You may need to do more to reach or maintain your weight-loss goal. Some, but not all, insurance plans cover medications that treat overweight and obesity. Contact your insurance provider to find out if your plan covers these medications. The table below lists FDA-approved prescription medications for weight loss. The FDA has approved five of these drugs\u2014orlistat (Xenical, Alli), lorcaserin (Belviq), phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia), naltrexone-bupropion (Contrave), and liraglutide (Saxenda)\u2014for long-term use. You can keep taking these drugs as long as you are benefiting from treatment and not having unpleasant side-effects.Some weight-loss medications that curb appetite are approved by the FDA only for short-term use, or up to 12 weeks. Although some doctors prescribe them for longer periods of time, not many research studies have looked at how safe and effective they are for long-term use.Pregnant women should never take weight-loss medications. Women who are planning to get pregnant also should avoid these medications, as some of them may harm a fetus.Prescription Medications Approved for Overweight and Obesity TreatmentWeight-loss medication Approved for How it works Common side effects Warnings Orlistat (Xenical) Available in lower dose without prescription (Alli) Adults and children ages 12 and older Works in your gut to reduce the amount of fat your body absorbs from the food you eat diarrhea gas leakage of oily stools stomach pain Rare cases of severe liver injury have been reported.

        "document": "Endometriosis (Other Endometriosis FAQs): - If I have endometriosis, will I be able to get pregnant? Among women with fertility problems, endometriosis may occur in as many as 50%.1 But exactly how endometriosis causes infertility is not clear. Some evidence suggests that infertility is related to the extent of the endometriosis patches, because the patches can distort the pelvic anatomy. This would make it difficult for sperm to travel to the ovary or a fertilized egg to travel to the uterus.2,3 Other evidence suggests that the inflammation in the abdomen may disrupt ovulation or fertilization, or that the endometrium may not develop properly, hampering the attachment of the embryo to the uterus. There are treatments for\u00a0endometriosis-related infertility that may help women get pregnant even with endometriosis. - Is endometriosis the same as endometrial cancer? Endometriosis and endometrial cancer are not the same. The word \"endometrium\" describes the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus. Endometrial cancer is a type of cancer that affects the lining of the inside of the uterus. Endometriosis itself is not a form of cancer. - Can endometriosis lead to cancer? There is a slight increase in the risk of ovarian cancer among women with endometriosis, particularly among women who were diagnosed with the condition at an early age. However, it is unclear whether endometriosis causes ovarian cancer or if the two conditions share risk factors or disease mechanisms that make them more likely to occur together.3,4 In some cases, women with endometriosis also have breast cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, these situations are rare.5 - Does endometriosis ever go away? For about one-quarter of women diagnosed with endometriosis, endometriosis patches go away on their own.6 Also, after menopause, symptoms of endometriosis typically lessen because there is a drop in the woman's natural hormones and the growths gradually shrink. However, this is not true for all women. If a woman takes hormones for menopausal symptoms, both her pain symptoms and the growths may return. Women with endometriosis who are experiencing symptoms, especially after menopause, should talk with their health care providers about treatment options."

        "document": "Endometriosis (Symptoms): The primary symptom of endometriosis is pelvic pain, often associated with your menstrual period. Although many women experience cramping during their menstrual period, women with endometriosis typically describe menstrual pain that's far worse than usual. They also tend to report that the pain increases over time. Common signs and symptoms of endometriosis may include: - Painful periods (dysmenorrhea). Pelvic pain and cramping may begin before your period and extend several days into your period. You may also have lower back and abdominal pain.   - Pain with intercourse. Pain during or after sex is common with endometriosis.   - Pain with bowel movements or urination. You're most likely to experience these symptoms during your period.   - Excessive bleeding. You may experience occasional heavy periods (menorrhagia) or bleeding between periods (menometrorrhagia).   - Infertility. Endometriosis is first diagnosed in some women who are seeking treatment for infertility.   - Other symptoms. You may also experience fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, bloating or nausea, especially during menstrual periods. The severity of your pain isn't necessarily a reliable indicator of the extent of the condition. Some women with mild endometriosis have intense pain, while others with advanced endometriosis may have little pain or even no pain at all. Endometriosis is sometimes mistaken for other conditions that can cause pelvic pain, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or ovarian cysts. It may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a condition that causes bouts of diarrhea, constipation and abdominal cramping. IBS can accompany endometriosis, which can complicate the diagnosis. See your doctor if you have signs and symptoms that may indicate endometriosis. Endometriosis can be a challenging condition to manage. An early diagnosis, a multidisciplinary medical team and an understanding of your diagnosis may result in better management of your symptoms."

Several different treatment options can help manage the symptoms and improve your chances of getting pregnant. Endometriosis, sometimes called \"endo,\" is a common health problem in women.

But they can still cause problems.  Endometriosis happens when tissue that is normally on the inside of your uterus or womb grows outside of your uterus or womb where it doesn't belong. Endometriosis growths bleed in the same way the lining inside of your uterus does every month - during your menstrual period.

You might be more likely to get endometriosis if you have: No one knows for sure what causes this disease. Researchers are studying possible causes: You can't prevent endometriosis.

The doctor will talk to you about your symptoms and do or prescribe one or more of the following to find out if you have endometriosis: There is no cure for endometriosis, but treatments are available for the symptoms and problems it causes. Talk to your doctor about your treatment options.  If you are not trying to get pregnant, hormonal birth control is generally the first step in treatment. This may include:  Hormonal treatment works only as long as it is taken and is best for women who do not have severe pain or symptoms.  If you are trying to get pregnant, your doctor may prescribe a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist. This medicine stops the body from making the hormones responsible for ovulation, the menstrual cycle, and the growth of endometriosis. This treatment causes a temporary menopause, but it also helps control the growth of endometriosis. Once you stop taking the medicine, your menstrual cycle returns, but you may have a better chance of getting pregnant.  Surgery is usually chosen for severe symptoms, when hormones are not providing relief or if you are having fertility problems.

Hormone therapy such as estrogen or birth control pills, given to reduce menopausal symptoms, may cause these endometriosis symptoms to continue.Researchers know that pain is a primary symptom of endometriosis, but it is not known how pain arises in women with endometriosis.The severity of pain does not correspond with the number, location, or extent of endometriosis lesions. Some women with only a few small lesions experience severe pain; other women may have very large patches of endometriosis, but only experience little pain.3,4Current evidence suggests several possible explanations for pain associated with endometriosis, including (but not limited to):3,4- Patches of endometriosis respond to hormones in a similar way as the lining of the uterus. These tissues may bleed or have evidence of inflammation every month, similar to a regular menstrual period. However, the blood and tissue shed from endometriosis patches stay in the body and are irritants, which can cause pain. - In some cases, inflammation and chemicals produced by the endometriosis areas can cause the pelvic organs to adhere, or stick together, causing scar tissue. This makes the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, as well as the bladder and rectum, appear as one large organ. - Hormones and chemicals released by endometriosis tissue also may irritate nearby tissue and cause the release of other chemicals known to cause pain. - Over time, some endometriosis areas may form nodules or bumps as they create lesions on the surface of pelvic organs or can become cysts (fluid-filled sacs) on the ovaries. - Some endometriosis lesions have nerves in them, tying the patches directly into the central nervous system. These nerves may be more sensitive to pain-causing chemicals released in the lesions and surrounding areas. Over time, they may be more easily activated by the chemicals than normal nerve cells are. - Patches of endometriosis might also press against nearby nerve cells to cause pain. - Some women report less endometriosis pain after pregnancy, but the reason for this is unclear. Researchers are trying to determine if the reduction results from the hormones released by the body during pregnancy, or from changes in the cervix, uterus, or endometrium that occur during pregnancy and delivery.Pain from endometriosis can be severe, interfering with day-to-day activities. Understanding how endometriosis is related to pain is a very active area of research because it could allow for more effective treatments for this specific type of pain."

By age 3, the child becomes knock-kneed. When the child stands, the knees touch but the ankles are apart.   By puberty, the legs straighten out and most children can stand with the knees and ankles touching (without forcing the position).   Knock knees can also develop as a result of a medical problem or disease, such as:     - Injury of the shinbone (only one leg will be knock-kneed)   - Osteomyelitis (bone infection)   - Overweight or obesity   - Rickets (a disease caused by a lack of vitamin D) A health care provider will examine your child. Tests will be done if there are signs that knock knees are not a part of normal development. Knock knees are not treated in most cases.   If the problem continues after age 7, the child may use a night brace. This brace is attached to a shoe.

        "query": "I have a fractured nose i need it fixed. its been broke for 3 years now",
        "document": "Broken nose: A broken nose, also called a nasal fracture, is a break or crack in a bone in your nose - often the bone over the bridge of your nose. Common causes of a broken nose include contact sports, physical fights, falls and motor vehicle accidents that result in facial trauma. A broken nose can cause pain, along with swelling and bruising around your nose and under your eyes. Your nose may look crooked, and you may have trouble breathing. Treatment for a broken nose may include procedures that realign your nose. Surgery usually isn't necessary for a broken nose. Signs and symptoms of a broken nose: - Pain or tenderness, especially when touching your nose   - Swelling of your nose and surrounding areas   - Bleeding from your nose   - Bruising around your nose or eyes   - Crooked or misshapen nose   - Difficulty breathing through your nose   - Discharge of mucus from your nose   - Feeling that one or both of your nasal passages are blocked When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical attention if you experience a nose injury accompanied by: - A head or neck injury, which may be marked by severe headache, neck pain, vomiting or loss of consciousness   - Difficulty breathing   - Bleeding you can't stop   - A noticeable change in the shape of your nose that isn't related to swelling, such as a crooked or twisted appearance   - Clear, watery fluid draining from your nose Common causes of a broken nose include: - Injury from contact sports, such as football or hockey   - Physical altercations   - Motor vehicle accidents   - Falls A broken nose can even be caused by walking into a fixed object, such as a door or wall, or by rough, wrestling-type play. Any activity that increases your risk of a facial injury increases your risk of a broken nose. Such activities may include: - Playing contact sports, such as football and hockey, especially without a helmet that has a face mask   - Engaging in a physical fight   - Riding a bicycle   - Lifting weights, especially if you don't use a spotter   - Riding in a motor vehicle, especially without a seat belt Complications or injuries related to a broken nose may include: - Deviated septum. A nose fracture may cause a deviated septum, a condition that occurs when the thin wall dividing the two sides of your nose (nasal septum) is displaced, narrowing your nasal passage. Medications, such as decongestants and antihistamines, can help you manage a deviated septum, but surgery is required to correct the condition.   - Collection of blood. Sometimes, pools of clotted blood form in a broken nose, creating a condition called a septal hematoma. A septal hematoma can block one or both nostrils. Septal hematoma requires prompt surgical drainage to prevent cartilage damage.   - Cartilage fracture. If your fracture is due to a forceful blow, such as from an automobile accident, you also may experience a cartilage fracture. If your injury is severe enough to warrant surgical treatment, the surgeon should address both your bone and cartilage injuries.   - Neck injury. Likewise, nose fractures resulting from high-velocity injuries - like those experienced in motor vehicle accidents - may be accompanied by injuries to your neck. If a blow is strong enough to break your nose, it may also be strong enough to damage the bones in your neck. If you suspect a neck injury, see your doctor immediately. Your doctor may press gently on the outside of your nose and its surrounding areas. He or she may look inside your nasal passage to check for obstruction and further signs of broken bones. Your doctor may use anesthetics - either a nasal spray or local injections - to make you more comfortable during the exam. X-rays and other imaging studies are usually unnecessary. However, your doctor may recommend a computerized tomography (CT) scan if the severity of your injuries makes a thorough physical exam impossible or if your doctor suspects you may have other injuries. If you have a minor fracture that hasn't caused your nose to become crooked or otherwise misshapen, you may not need professional medical treatment. Your doctor may recommend simple self-care measures, such as using ice on the area and taking over-the-counter pain medications. Fixing displacements and breaks Your doctor may be able to realign your nose manually, or you may need surgery. Manual realignment If the break has displaced the bones and cartilage in your nose, your doctor may be able to manually realign them. This needs to be done within 14 days from when the fracture occurred, preferably sooner. During this procedure, your doctor: - Administers medication by injection or nasal spray to ease discomfort - Opens your nostrils with a nasal speculum - Uses special instruments to help realign your broken bones and cartilage Your doctor will also splint your nose using packing in your nose and a dressing on the outside. Sometimes, an internal splint is also necessary for a short time. The packing usually needs to stay in for a week. You'll also be given a prescription for antibiotics to prevent infection with the bacteria that may normally reside in your nose. Surgery Severe breaks, multiple breaks or breaks that have gone untreated for more than 14 days may not be candidates for manual realignment. In these cases, surgery to realign the bones and reshape your nose may be necessary. If the break has damaged your nasal septum, causing obstruction or difficulty breathing, reconstructive surgery may be recommended. Surgery is typically performed on an outpatient basis. If you think you may have broken your nose, take these steps to reduce pain and swelling before seeing your doctor: - Act quickly. When the break first occurs, breathe through your mouth and lean forward to reduce the amount of blood that drains into your throat. - Use ice. Apply ice packs or cold compresses immediately after the injury, and then at least four times a day for the first 24 to 48 hours to reduce swelling. Keep the ice or cold compress on for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Wrap the ice in a washcloth to prevent frostbite. Try not to apply too much pressure, which can cause additional pain or damage to your nose. - Relieve pain. Take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others), as necessary. - Keep your head up. Elevate your head - especially when sleeping - so as not to worsen swelling and throbbing. - Limit your activities. For the first two weeks after treatment, don't play any sports. Avoid contact sports for at least six weeks after your injury."

        "document": "Rhinoplasty: Rhinoplasty is surgery to repair or reshape the nose. Rhinoplasty can be performed under local or general anesthesia, depending on the exact procedure and the person's preference. It is performed in a surgeon's office, a hospital, or an outpatient surgery center. Complex procedures may require a short hospital stay. The procedure often takes 1 to 2 hours. It may take longer.   With local anesthesia, the nose and the area around it are numbed. You will probably be lightly sedated, but awake during the surgery (relaxed and not feeling pain). General anesthesia allows you to sleep through the operation.   The surgery is usually done through a cut (incision) made inside the nostrils. In some cases, the cut is made from outside, around the base of the nose. This type of cut is used to perform work on the tip of the nose or if you need a cartilage graft. If the nose needs to be narrowed, the incision may extend around the nostrils. Small incisions may be made on the side of the nose to break, and reshape the bone.   A splint (metal or plastic) may be placed on the outside of the nose. This helps maintain the new shape of the bone when the surgery is finished. Soft plastic splints or nasal packs also may be placed in the nostrils. This helps keep the dividing wall between the air passages (septum) stable. Rhinoplasty is one of the most common plastic surgery procedures. It can be used to:     - Reduce or increase the size of the nose   - Change the shape of the tip or the nasal bridge   - Narrow the opening of the nostrils   - Change the angle between the nose and the upper lip   - Correct a birth defect or injury   - Help relieve some breathing problems      Nose surgery is considered elective when it is done for cosmetic reasons. In these cases, the purpose is to change the shape of the nose to one that the person finds more desirable. Many surgeons prefer to perform cosmetic nose surgery after the nasal bone has finished growing. This is around age 14 or 15 for girls and a bit later for boys. Risks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:     - Reactions to medicines, problems breathing   - Bleeding, infection, or bruising      Risks for this procedure include:     - Loss of support of the nose   - Contour deformities of the nose   - Need for further surgery     After surgery, tiny blood vessels that have burst may appear as tiny red spots on the skin surface. These are usually minor, but are permanent. There are no visible scars if the rhinoplasty is performed from inside the nose. If the procedure narrows flared nostrils, there may be small scars at the base of the nose that are not often visible.   In rare cases, a second procedure is needed to fix a minor deformity. Your surgeon may give you instructions to follow before your surgery. You may need to:     - Stop any medicines that thin your blood. Your surgeon will give you a list of these medicines.   - See your regular health care provider to have some routine tests and make sure it is safe for you to have surgery.   - To aid with healing, stop smoking 2 to 3 weeks before and after surgery.   - Arrange to have someone drive you home after surgery. You will usually go home on the same day as your surgery.   Right after surgery, your nose and face will be swollen and painful. Headaches are common.   The nasal packing is usually removed in 3 to 5 days, after which you will feel more comfortable.   The splint may be left in place for 1 to 2 weeks. Full recovery takes several weeks.   Healing is a slow and gradual process. The tip of the nose may have some swelling and numbness for months. You may not be able to see the final results for up to a year. Updated by: David A.

        "document": "Nose fracture: A nose fracture is a break in the bone or cartilage over the bridge, or in the sidewall or septum (structure that divides the nostrils) of the nose. A fractured nose is the most common fracture of the face. It most often occurs after an injury and often occurs with other fractures of the face.   Nose injuries and neck injuries are often seen together. A blow that is forceful enough to injure the nose may be hard enough to injure the neck.   Serious nose injuries cause problems that need a health care provider's attention right away. For example, damage to the cartilage can cause a collection of blood to form inside the nose. If this blood is not drained right away, it can cause an abscess or a permanent deformity that blocks the nose. It may lead to tissue death and cause the nose to collapse.   For minor nose injuries, the provider may want to see the person within the first week after the injury to see if the nose has moved out of its normal shape.   Sometimes, surgery may be needed to correct a nose or septum that has been bent out of shape by an injury. Symptoms may include:     - Blood coming from the nose   - Bruising around the eyes   - Difficulty breathing through the nose   - Misshapen appearance (may not be obvious until the swelling goes down)   - Pain   - Swelling     The bruised appearance most often disappears after 2 weeks. If a nose injury happens:     - Try to stay calm.   - Breathe through your mouth and lean forward in a sitting position to keep blood from going down the back of your throat.   - Squeeze the nostrils closed and hold pressure to stop the bleeding.   - Apply cold compresses to your nose to reduce swelling. If possible, hold the compress so that there isn't too much pressure on the nose.   - To help relieve pain, try acetaminophen (Tylenol). - DO NOT try to straighten a broken nose   - DO NOT move the person if there is reason to suspect a head or neck injury Get medical help right away if:     - Bleeding will not stop   - Clear fluid keeps draining from the nose   - You suspect a blood clot in the septum   - You suspect a neck or head injury   - The nose looks deformed or out of its usual shape   - The person is having difficulty breathing Wear protective headgear while playing contact sports, or\u00a0riding bicycles, skateboards, roller skates, or rollerblades.   Use seat belts and appropriate car seats when driving. Updated by: Josef Shargorodsky, MD, MPH, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing.

        "document": "Anal fissure: An anal fissure is a small tear in the thin, moist tissue (mucosa) that lines the anus. An anal fissure may occur when you pass hard or large stools during a bowel movement. Anal fissures typically cause pain and bleeding with bowel movements. You also may experience spasms in the ring of muscle at the end of your anus (anal sphincter). Anal fissures are very common in young infants but can affect people of any age. Most anal fissures get better with simple treatments, such as increased fiber intake or sitz baths. Some people with anal fissures may need medication or, occasionally, surgery. Signs and symptoms of an anal fissure include: - Pain, sometimes severe, during bowel movements   - Pain after bowel movements that can last up to several hours   - Bright red blood on the stool or toilet paper after a bowel movement   - Itching or irritation around the anus   - A visible crack in the skin around the anus   - A small lump or skin tag on the skin near the anal fissure When to see a doctor See your doctor if you have pain during bowel movements or notice blood on stools or toilet paper after a bowel movement. Common causes of anal fissure include: - Passing large or hard stools   - Constipation and straining during bowel movements   - Chronic diarrhea   - Inflammation of the anorectal area, caused by Crohn's disease or another inflammatory bowel disease   - Childbirth Less common causes of anal fissures include: - Anal cancer   - HIV   - Tuberculosis   - Syphilis   - Herpes Factors that may increase your risk of developing an anal fissure include: - Infancy. Many infants experience an anal fissure during their first year of life; experts aren't sure why.   - Aging. Older adults may develop an anal fissure partly due to slowed circulation, resulting in decreased blood flow to the rectal area.   - Constipation. Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing.   - Childbirth. Anal fissures are more common in women after they give birth.   - Crohn's disease. This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract, which may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing.   - Anal intercourse. Complications of anal fissure can include: - Failure to heal. An anal fissure that fails to heal within six weeks is considered chronic and may need further treatment.   - Recurrence. Once you've experienced an anal fissure, you are prone to having another one.   - A tear that extends to surrounding muscles. An anal fissure may extend into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed (internal anal sphincter), making it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal. An unhealed fissure can trigger a cycle of discomfort that may require medications or surgery to reduce the pain and to repair or remove the fissure. If possible, your doctor will perform a digital rectal exam, which involves inserting a gloved finger into your anal canal, or use a short, lighted tube (anoscope) to inspect your anal canal. However, if this is too painful for you, your doctor may be able to diagnose an anal fissure only by observation. An acute anal fissure looks like a fresh tear, somewhat like a paper cut. A chronic anal fissure likely has the tear, as well as two separate lumps or tags of skin, one internal (sentinel pile) and one external (hypertrophied papilla). The fissure's location offers clues about its cause. A fissure that occurs on the side of the anal opening, rather than the back or front, is more likely to be a sign of another disorder, such as Crohn's disease. Your doctor may recommend further testing if he or she thinks you have an underlying condition: - Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Your doctor will insert a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video into the bottom portion of your colon. This test may be done if you're younger than 50 and have no risk factors for intestinal diseases or colon cancer. - Colonoscopy. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube into your rectum to inspect the entire colon. This test may be done if you are older than age 50 or you have risk factors for colon cancer, signs of other conditions, or other symptoms such as abdominal pain or diarrhea. Anal fissures often heal within a few weeks if you take steps to keep your stool soft, such as increasing your intake of fiber and fluids. Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing.

Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence. Several lifestyle changes may help relieve discomfort and promote healing of an anal fissure, as well as prevent recurrences: - Add fiber to your diet. Eating about 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day can help keep stools soft and improve fissure healing. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains. You also can take a fiber supplement. Adding fiber may cause gas and bloating, so increase your intake gradually. - Drink adequate fluids. Fluids help prevent constipation. - Exercise regularly. Engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity, such as walking, most days of the week. Exercise promotes regular bowel movements and increases blood flow to all parts of your body, which may promote healing of an anal fissure. - Avoid straining during bowel movements. Straining creates pressure, which can open a healing tear or cause a new tear. If your infant has an anal fissure, be sure to change diapers frequently, wash the area gently and discuss the problem with your child's doctor."

The signs and symptoms vary but may include neonatal respiratory distress; frequent lung, sinus and middle ear infections beginning in early childhood; and infertility. [1] [2] [3] It can be cause by changes ( mutations ) in many different genes that are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

Treatment varies based on the signs and symptoms present in each person but may include airway clearance therapy and antibiotics . [1] [2] [3] Kartagener syndrome is characterized by p and situs inversus totalis. In people affected by situs inversus totalis, the internal organs including the heart, liver, spleen and intestine are on the opposite side of the body. Although the internal organs are abnormally placed, this condition typically does not cause any health problems. [1] [2] The signs and symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia vary, but may include: [1] [2] [3] Neonatal respiratory distress Frequent respiratory\u00a0infections that\u00a0can lead to severe lung damage Chronic nasal congestion Frequent sinus infections Recurrent middle ear infections, particularly\u00a0in early childhood Hearing loss Hydrocephalus Infertility Kartagener syndrome can be caused by changes ( mutations ) in many different genes . These genes encode proteins that are important to the structure and function of cilia. Cilia are tiny, hair-like structures that are found on the surface of cells in various parts of the body such as the lining of the airway, the reproductive system, and other organs . The coordinated movement of cilia in wave-like motions is important to the normal functioning of\u00a0certain organs and tissues throughout the body and ensures the proper placement of organs in the developing embryo. Mutations in these genes cause the cilia to be either immotile (unable to move) or dysmotile (they move incorrectly), which leads to the many signs and symptoms of Kartagener syndrome. [1] [4] [3] Scientists have identified several different genes that are associated with Kartagener syndrome; however, the genetic cause is unknown in some cases. [1] [4] [3] Kartagener syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. [4] This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell . The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers . Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier. Kartagener syndrome is typically suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. A diagnosis can be confirmed by examining a small sample of tissue ( biopsy ) from an area of the body known to have cilia such as the sinus cavities or the airway. Abnormalities in the structure of cilia, as seen in people affected by Kartagener syndrome, can be observed under a special microscope (called an electron microscope). If the disease-causing change ( mutation ) is known, genetic testing can also be used to confirm the diagnosis.

        "document": "SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis (Description): SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis is a kidney (renal) disorder that sometimes includes blood cell abnormalities. The kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine; however, in people with distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys are unable to remove enough acid from the body, and the blood becomes too acidic. This chemical imbalance is called metabolic acidosis. The inability to remove acids from the body often results in slowed growth and may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. This bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. In addition, most children and adults with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis have excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria), calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). In rare cases, these kidney abnormalities lead to life-threatening kidney failure. Affected individuals may also have low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia).   Individuals with the features described above have complete distal renal tubular acidosis, which usually becomes apparent in childhood. Some people do not develop metabolic acidosis even though their kidneys have trouble removing acids; these individuals are said to have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis. Additionally, these individuals may have other features of distal renal tubular acidosis, such as bone problems and kidney stones. Often, people who initially have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis develop metabolic acidosis later in life.   Some people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis also have blood cell abnormalities. These can vary in severity from no symptoms to a condition called hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells prematurely break down (undergo hemolysis), causing a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath (dyspnea), and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly).   There are two forms of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis; they are distinguished by their inheritance pattern. The autosomal dominant form is more common and is usually less severe than the autosomal recessive form. The autosomal dominant form can be associated with incomplete or complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is rarely associated with blood cell abnormalities. The autosomal recessive form is always associated with complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is more commonly associated with blood cell abnormalities, although not everyone with this form has abnormal blood cells."

        "document": "SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis (Genetic Changes): Both the autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis are caused by mutations in the SLC4A1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making the anion exchanger 1 (AE1) protein, which transports negatively charged atoms (anions) across cell membranes. Specifically, AE1 exchanges negatively charged atoms of chlorine (chloride ions) for negatively charged bicarbonate molecules (bicarbonate ions). The AE1 protein is found in the cell membrane of kidney cells and red blood cells. In kidney cells, the exchange of bicarbonate through AE1 allows acid to be released from the cell into the urine. In red blood cells, AE1 attaches to other proteins that make up the structural framework (the cytoskeleton) of the cells, helping to maintain their structure.   The SLC4A1 gene mutations involved in either form of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis lead to production of altered AE1 proteins that cannot get to the correct location in the cell membrane. In the autosomal dominant form of the condition, gene mutations affect only one copy of the SLC4A1 gene, and normal AE1 protein is produced from the other copy. However, the altered protein attaches to the normal protein and keeps it from getting to the correct location, leading to a severe reduction or absence of AE1 protein in the cell membrane. In autosomal recessive distal renal tubular acidosis, both copies of the SLC4A1 gene are mutated, so all of the protein produced from this gene is altered and not able to get to the correct location. Improper location or absence of AE1 in kidney cell membranes disrupts bicarbonate exchange, and as a result, acid cannot be released into the urine. Instead, the acid builds up in the blood in most affected individuals, leading to metabolic acidosis and the other features of complete distal renal tubular acidosis. It is not clear why some people develop metabolic acidosis and others do not. Researchers suggest that in individuals with incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis, another mechanism is able to help regulate blood acidity (pH) and keep metabolic acidosis from developing.   In red blood cells, interaction with a protein called glycophorin A can often help the altered AE1 protein get to the cell membrane where it can perform its function, which explains why most people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis do not have blood cell abnormalities. However, some altered AE1 proteins cannot be helped by glycophorin A and are not found in the cell membrane. Without AE1, the red blood cells are unstable; breakdown of these abnormal red blood cells may lead to hemolytic anemia.   Some people have nonhereditary forms of distal renal tubular acidosis; these forms can be caused by immune system problems or other conditions that damage the kidneys. These individuals often have additional signs and symptoms related to the original condition."

        "document": "SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis (Inheritance Pattern): SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis can have different patterns of inheritance. It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered SLC4A1 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.   Less commonly, SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means a mutation must occur in both copies of the SLC4A1 gene for the condition to develop. This pattern occurs with certain types of SLC4A1 gene mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition."

        "document": "Lewy body dementia: Lewy body dementia is one of the most common forms of progressive dementia. People affected by this condition may experience a variety of symptoms such as changes in alertness and attention; hallucinations; problems with movement and posture; muscle stiffness; confusion; and/or memory loss. Although the exact cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood, symptoms are thought to\u00a0result when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein (\"Lewy bodies\") accumulate in the brain. Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Rarely, more than one family member may be affected. There is currently no cure for Lewy body dementia; however,\u00a0medications may be available to help manage the associated symptoms. [1] [2] [3] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Delusions - Dementia - Fluctuations in consciousness - Parkinsonism - Visual hallucinations - The exact underlying cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood. The symptoms of the condition are thought to occur when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein accumulate in the regions of the brain involved in thinking, memory and movement. The build-up of these clumps (which are called \"Lewy bodies\") appears to be associated with a loss of certain neurons (nerve cells ) in the brain that produce two important neurotransmitters (chemicals that act as messengers between brain cells). The neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, is important for memory and learning. The other, dopamine, plays an important role in behavior, cognition, movement, motivation, sleep, and mood. [4] Although Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically, more than one family member can rarely be affected. Studies of these families suggest that there may be a genetic component to the condition in some cases. For example, copy number variants or changes ( mutations ) in the SNCA gene have been reported in a few affected families. [5] [6] The APOE \u03b54 allele and mutations in the GBA gene have been associated with an increased risk of Lewy body dementia and the APOE \u03b52 allele with a decreased risk. [5] [7] [2] Most cases of Lewy body dementia are not thought to be inherited . The condition generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. [4] Rarely, the condition can affect more than one family member. Some of these cases appear to be due to single gene changes ( mutations ) that follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Other familial cases\u00a0do not follow a specific pattern of inheritance and likely have a multifactorial cause (associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors ). [6] [5] Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person\u2019s medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional. Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers.

Children who have Tay-Sachs disease are at high risk of lung infections that cause breathing problems and frequently accumulate mucus in their lungs. Your child may need the mucus using chest physiotherapy (CPT) to help remove mucus from the lungs. - Feeding tubes. Your child may have trouble swallowing, or develop respiratory problems by inhaling food or liquid into the lungs while eating. To prevent those problems, your doctor may recommend an assistive feeding device such as a gastrostomy tube, which is inserted through your child's nose and goes to your child's stomach. Or, a doctor trained in stomach surgery may surgically insert an esophagogastrostomy tube. - Physical therapy. As the disease progresses, your child may benefit from physical therapy to help keep joints flexible and maintain as much ability to move (range of motion) as possible.

The incidence of Tay-Sachs has been particularly high among people of Eastern European and Askhenazi Jewish descent., as well as in certain French Canadians and Louisiana Cajuns. Affected individuals and carriers of Tay-Sachs disease can be identified by a blood test that measures hexosaminidase A activity. Both parents must carry the mutated gene in order to have an affected child. In these instances, there is a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy that the child will be affected with Tay-Sachs disease. Prenatal diagnosis is available if desired. \u00a0A very severe form of Tay-Sachs disease is know as Sandhoff disease, which is not limited to any ethnic group. Presently there is no specific treatment for Tay-Sachs disease. Anticonvulsant medicine may initially control seizures. Other supportive treatment includes proper nutrition and hydration and techniques to keep the airway open. Children may eventually need a feeding tube.

        "document": "Menkes syndrome: In Menkes syndrome, cells in the body can absorb copper, but they are unable to release it. It is one of several conditions called an \"inborn error of metabolism.\" Menkes syndrome is caused by a defect in the ATP7A gene. The defect makes it hard for the body to distribute copper in food from the intestines into the bloodstream for use in other areas. As a result, the brain and other parts of the body do not get enough copper.   Copper can build up in the small intestine and kidneys, but low copper levels in other areas can affect the structure of bone, skin, hair, and blood vessels, and interfere with nerve function.    Menkes syndrome is inherited, which means it runs in families. The gene is on the X-chromosome, so if a mother carries the defective gene, each of her sons has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of developing the disease, and 50% of her daughters will be a carrier of the disease. Symptoms of Menkes syndrome are:     - Bone spurs   - Brittle, kinky hair   - Feeding difficulties   - Irritability   - Lack of muscle tone, floppiness   - Low body temperature   - Mental deterioration   - Pudgy, rosy cheeks   - Seizures   - Skeletal changes There is often a history of Menkes syndrome in a male relative.   Signs include:     - Abnormal appearance of the hair under a microscope   - Abnormally low body temperature   - Bleeding in the brain   - Slow growth in the womb      In males, all of the hairs will be abnormal. In females who carry this trait, half of them may have areas of abnormal hair.   Tests may include:     - Serum ceruloplasmin (substance that transports copper in the blood)   - Serum copper level   - Skin cell culture   - X-ray of the skeleton or x-ray of the skull     Genetic testing may show a change (mutation) in the ATP7A gene. Treatment usually only helps when started very early in the course of the disease. Injections of copper into a vein or under the skin have been used with mixed results. Most people with this condition die within the first few years of life. - Seizures   - Death Talk to your health care provider if you have a family history of Menkes syndrome and you plan to have children. A baby with this condition will often show symptoms early in infancy. See a genetic counselor if you want to have children and you have a family history of Menkes syndrome. Maternal relatives (relatives on the mother's side of the family) of a boy with this syndrome should be seen by a geneticist to find out if they are carriers.

        "document": "ATP7A gene (Menkes syndrome): Researchers have identified more than 150 mutations in the ATP7A gene that cause Menkes syndrome. Many of these mutations delete part of the gene and likely result in a shortened ATP7A protein. Other mutations insert additional DNA building blocks (nucleotides) into the gene or change single nucleotides. All of these mutations prevent the production of functional ATP7A protein. As a result, the absorption of copper from food is impaired, and copper is not supplied to certain enzymes. The abnormal protein may get stuck in the cell membrane and become unable to shuttle back and forth from the Golgi apparatus.   The disrupted activity of the ATP7A protein causes copper to be poorly distributed to cells in the body. Copper accumulates in some tissues, such as the small intestine and kidneys, while the brain and other tissues have unusually low levels. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes, affecting the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. The signs and symptoms of Menkes syndrome are caused by the reduced activity of these copper-containing enzymes."

        "document": "Milroy disease: Milroy disease is a condition that affects the normal function of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system produces and transports fluids and immune cells throughout the body. Impaired transport with accumulation of lymph fluid can cause swelling (lymphedema). Individuals with Milroy disease typically have lymphedema in their lower legs and feet at birth or develop it in infancy. The lymphedema typically occurs on both sides of the body and may worsen over time.   Milroy disease is associated with other features in addition to lymphedema. Males with Milroy disease are sometimes born with an accumulation of fluid in the scrotum (hydrocele). Males and females may have upslanting toenails, deep creases in the toes, wart-like growths (papillomas), and prominent leg veins. Some individuals develop non-contagious skin infections called cellulitis that can damage the thin tubes that carry lymph fluid (lymphatic vessels). Episodes of cellulitis can cause further swelling in the lower limbs. Milroy disease is a rare disorder; its incidence is unknown. Mutations in the FLT4 gene cause some cases of Milroy disease. The FLT4 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3), which regulates the development and maintenance of the lymphatic system. Mutations in the FLT4 gene interfere with the growth, movement, and survival of cells that line the lymphatic vessels (lymphatic endothelial cells). These mutations lead to the development of small or absent lymphatic vessels. If lymph fluid is not properly transported, it builds up in the body's tissues and causes lymphedema. It is not known how mutations in the FLT4 gene lead to the other features of this disorder.   Many individuals with Milroy disease do not have a mutation in the FLT4 gene. In these individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Milroy disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In many cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases may result from new mutations in the FLT4 gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. About 10 percent to 15 percent of people with a mutation in the FLT4 gene do not develop the features of Milroy disease.

        "document": "EVC gene: The EVC gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unclear. However, it appears to be important for normal growth and development, particularly the development of bones and teeth. The EVC protein is found in primary cilia, which are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells and are involved in signaling pathways that transmit information between cells. In particular, the EVC protein is thought to help regulate a signaling pathway known as Sonic Hedgehog, which plays roles in cell growth, cell specialization, and the normal shaping (patterning) of many parts of the body.   EVC and another gene, EVC2, are located very close together on chromosome 4. Researchers believe that the two genes may have related functions and that their activity may be coordinated. More than 25 mutations in the EVC gene have been reported to cause Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, an inherited disorder characterized by dwarfism, abnormal nails and teeth, and heart defects. The mutations that cause this condition occur in both copies of the EVC gene in each cell. These genetic changes disrupt the normal function of the EVC protein or lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the protein. Although it is unclear how the loss of this protein's function underlies the signs and symptoms of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, researchers believe that it may prevent normal Sonic Hedgehog signaling in the developing embryo. Problems with this signaling pathway may ultimately lead to the abnormal bone growth and heart defects seen with this condition.

Problems with this signaling pathway may ultimately lead to the abnormal bone growth and heart defects seen with this condition. At least one mutation in the EVC gene has been found to cause the characteristic features of Weyers acrofacial dysostosis, affecting the development of the teeth, nails, and bones. The signs and symptoms of Weyers acrofacial dysostosis are similar to, but typically milder than, those of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome.   The EVC gene mutation that causes Weyers acrofacial dysostosis occurs in one copy of the gene in each cell. It changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the EVC protein, replacing the amino acid serine with the amino acid proline at position 307 (written as Ser307Pro). It is unclear how this genetic change leads to the specific features of Weyers acrofacial dysostosis. Studies suggest that the abnormal protein interferes with Sonic Hedgehog signaling in the developing embryo, disrupting the normal formation and growth of the teeth, nails, and bones.

More than half of affected individuals are born with a heart defect, which can cause serious or life-threatening health problems.   The features of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome overlap with those of another, milder condition called Weyers acrofacial dysostosis. Like Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, Weyers acrofacial dysostosis involves tooth and nail abnormalities, although affected individuals have less pronounced short stature and typically do not have heart defects.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the medicines most often used. ACE inhibitors and ARBs may also help decrease the amount of protein lost in the urine.   - Corticosteroids and other drugs that suppress or quiet the immune system.   - Treating high cholesterol to reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel problems. A low-fat, low-cholesterol diet is usually not enough for people with nephrotic syndrome. Medicines to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides (usually statins) may be needed.   - A low-salt diet may help with swelling in the hands and legs. Water pills (diuretics) may also help with this problem.   - Low-protein diets may be helpful.

        "document": "autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness: Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing and distinguishing objects in low light (night blindness). For example, they may not be able to identify road signs at night or see stars in the night sky. They also often have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), nearsightedness (myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus).   The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is likely a rare disease; however, its prevalence is unknown. Mutations in several genes can cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Each of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the retina. These proteins are involved in sending (transmitting) visual signals from cells called rods, which are specialized for vision in low light, to cells called bipolar cells, which relay the signals to other retinal cells. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain.   Mutations in two genes, GRM6 and TRPM1, cause most cases of this condition. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for bipolar cells to receive and relay signals. Mutations in other genes involved in the same bipolar cell signaling pathway are likely responsible for a small percentage of cases of autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness.   Gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness disrupt the transmission of visual signals between rod cells and bipolar cells or interfere with the bipolar cells' ability to pass on these signals. As a result, visual information received by rod cells cannot be effectively transmitted to the brain, leading to difficulty seeing in low light. The cause of the other vision problems associated with this condition is unclear. It has been suggested that the mechanisms that underlie night blindness can interfere with other visual systems, causing myopia, reduced visual acuity, and other impairments.   Some people with autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness have no identified mutation in any of the known genes. The cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

        "query": "Is optic atrophy ginetic and what cause it?",
        "document": "optic atrophy type 1: Optic atrophy type 1 is a condition that often causes slowly worsening vision, usually beginning in childhood. People with optic atrophy type 1 typically experience a narrowing of their field of vision (tunnel vision). Affected individuals gradually lose their sight as their field of vision becomes smaller. Both eyes are usually affected equally, but the severity of the vision loss varies widely, even among affected members of the same family, ranging from nearly normal vision to complete blindness.   In addition to vision loss, people with optic atrophy type 1 frequently have problems with color vision (color vision deficiency) that make it difficult or impossible to distinguish between shades of blue and green.   In the early stages of the condition, individuals with optic atrophy type 1 experience a progressive loss of certain cells within the retina, which is a specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. The loss of these cells (known as retinal ganglion cells) is followed by the degeneration (atrophy) of the nerves that relay visual information from the eye to the brain (optic nerves), which results in further vision loss. Atrophy causes these nerves to have an abnormally pale appearance (pallor), which can be seen during an eye examination. Optic atrophy type 1 is estimated to affect 1 in 35,000 people worldwide. This condition is more common in Denmark, where it affects approximately 1 in 10,000 people. Optic atrophy type 1 is caused by mutations in the OPA1 gene. The protein produced from this gene is made in cells and tissues throughout the body. The OPA1 protein is found within mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells. The protein plays a key role in the organization of the shape and structure of the mitochondria and in controlled cell death (apoptosis). The OPA1 protein is also involved in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, from which cells derive much of their energy. Additionally, the protein plays a role in the maintenance of the DNA within mitochondria, called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).   Mutations in the OPA1 gene lead to problems with mitochondrial function. The mitochondria become misshapen and disorganized and have reduced energy-producing capabilities. The maintenance of mtDNA may also be impaired, resulting in mtDNA mutations that further interfere with mitochondrial energy production. Cells that contain these poorly functioning mitochondria are more susceptible to apoptosis. In particular, cells that have high energy demands, such as retinal ganglion cells, die over time. Specialized extensions of retinal ganglion cells, called axons, form the optic nerves, so when retinal ganglion cells die, the optic nerves atrophy and cannot transmit visual information to the brain. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.   In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.   In rare cases, people who have an OPA1 gene mutation do not develop optic atrophy type 1, a situation known as reduced penetrance. Delettre-Cribaillet C, Hamel CP, Lenaers G.

        "document": "Optic nerve atrophy: Optic nerve atrophy is damage to the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries images of what the eye sees to the brain. There are many causes of optic atrophy. The most common is poor blood flow. This is called ischemic optic neuropathy. The problem most often affects older adults. The optic nerve can also be damaged by shock, toxins, radiation, and trauma.   Eye diseases, such as glaucoma, can also cause a form of optic nerve atrophy. The condition can also be caused by diseases of the brain and central nervous system. These may include:      - Brain tumor   - Cranial arteritis (sometimes called temporal arteritis)   - Multiple sclerosis   - Stroke     There are also rare forms of hereditary optic nerve atrophy that affect children and young adults. Optic nerve atrophy causes vision to dim and reduces the field of vision. The ability to see fine detail will also be lost. Colors will seem faded. Over time, the pupil will be less able to react to light, and eventually,\u00a0its ability to react to light may be lost. The health care provider will do a complete eye exam to look for the condition. The exam will include tests of:     - Color vision   - Pupil light reflex   - Tonometry   - Visual acuity      You may also need a complete physical exam and other tests. Damage from optic nerve atrophy cannot be reversed. The underlying disease must be found and treated. Otherwise, vision loss will continue.    Rarely, conditions that lead to optic atrophy may be treatable. Vision lost to optic nerve atrophy cannot be recovered. It is very important to protect the other eye. People with this condition need to be checked regularly by an eye doctor with experience in nerve-related conditions. Tell your doctor right away about any change in vision.

        "query": "Is optic atrophy ginetic and what cause it?",
        "document": "Optic atrophy 1: Optic atrophy 1 is a condition that mainly affects vision, but may include other features. Vision loss typically begins within the first decade of life; severity varies widely among affected people (from nearly normal vision to complete blindness), even among members of the same family. Vision problems may include difficulty distinguishing colors,\u00a0progressive narrowing of the field of vision (tunnel vision) and an abnormally pale appearance (pallor) of the optic nerve.\u00a0Additional, less common abnormalities may include sensorineural hearing loss , ataxia , myopathy (muscle disease)\u00a0and other neurological findings. [1] It is usually caused by\u00a0 mutations in the OPA1 gene , although some individuals with optic atrophy 1 do not have identified mutations in\u00a0this gene,\u00a0in which case the cause of the condition is unknown. This condition is inherited in an\u00a0 autosomal dominant pattern but some cases result from a new mutation in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. [2] Treatment focuses on individual symptoms when possible. [1] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Ataxia Very rare Horizontal nystagmus Very rare Progressive external ophthalmoplegia Very rare Proximal muscle weakness Very rare Strabismus Very rare Abnormal amplitude of pattern reversal visual evoked potentials - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Central scotoma - Centrocecal scotoma - Incomplete penetrance - Insidious onset - Optic atrophy - Red-green dyschromatopsia - Reduced visual acuity - Tritanomaly - Visual impairment - View complete list of signs and symptoms... The resources below provide information about treatment options for this condition. If you have questions about which treatment is right for you, talk to your healthcare professional. Management Guidelines GeneReviews provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application of genetic testing to the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with specific inherited conditions. A thorough search of available literature\u00a0provided very limited information about how optic atrophy 1 may affect life expectancy. A recent study discussed how extra-ocular neurological complications may be\u00a0more common than previously thought in individuals with an OPA1 gene mutation and may affect up to 20% of individuals. The authors of the study described new clinical features\u00a0including spastic paraplegia (stiffness of the legs) and a multiple sclerosis-like illness. [3] Ongoing research and follow-up of individuals with the condition may provide specific information about life expectancy in the future.\u00a0Vision loss alone is not expected to\u00a0substantially shorten the life span; however, severe neurological symptoms, when present, theoretically may contribute to a shortened life span in some individuals.

        "query": "Are there any researches indicating how early an individual may experience any signs or symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis?",
        "document": "Rheumatoid arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect more than just your joints. In some people, the condition also can damage a wide variety of body systems, including the skin, eyes, lungs, heart and blood vessels. An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body's tissues. Unlike the wear-and-tear damage of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of your joints, causing a painful swelling that can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity. The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis is what can damage other parts of the body as well. While new types of medications have improved treatment options dramatically, severe rheumatoid arthritis can still cause physical disabilities. Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: - Tender, warm, swollen joints   - Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity   - Fatigue, fever and weight loss Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first - particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. About 40 percent of the people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many nonjoint structures, including: - Skin   - Eyes   - Lungs   - Heart   - Kidneys   - Salivary glands   - Nerve tissue   - Bone marrow   - Blood vessels Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission - when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent discomfort and swelling in your joints. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system attacks the synovium - the lining of the membranes that surround your joints. The resulting inflammation thickens the synovium, which can eventually destroy the cartilage and bone within the joint. The tendons and ligaments that hold the joint together weaken and stretch. Gradually, the joint loses its shape and alignment. Doctors don't know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely. While your genes don't actually cause rheumatoid arthritis, they can make you more susceptible to environmental factors - such as infection with certain viruses and bacteria - that may trigger the disease. Factors that may increase your risk of rheumatoid arthritis include: - Your sex. Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis.   - Age. Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins between the ages of 40 and 60.   - Family history. If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease.   - Smoking. Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity.   - Environmental exposures. Although uncertain and poorly understood, some exposures such as asbestos or silica may increase the risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis. Emergency workers exposed to dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center are at higher risk of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.   - Obesity. People who are overweight or obese appear to be at somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, especially in women diagnosed with the disease when they were 55 or younger. Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages because the early signs and symptoms mimic those of many other diseases. There is no one blood test or physical finding to confirm the diagnosis. During the physical exam, your doctor will check your joints for swelling, redness and warmth. He or she may also check your reflexes and muscle strength. Blood tests People with rheumatoid arthritis often have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, or sed rate) or C-reactive protein (CRP), which may indicate the presence of an inflammatory process in the body. Other common blood tests look for rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies. Imaging tests Your doctor may recommend X-rays to help track the progression of rheumatoid arthritis in your joints over time. MRI and ultrasound tests can help your doctor judge the severity of the disease in your body. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis. But recent discoveries indicate that remission of symptoms is more likely when treatment begins early with strong medications known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Medications The types of medications recommended by your doctor will depend on the severity of your symptoms and how long you've had rheumatoid arthritis. - NSAIDs. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Stronger NSAIDs are available by prescription. Side effects may include ringing in your ears, stomach irritation, heart problems, and liver and kidney damage. - Steroids. Corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, reduce inflammation and pain and slow joint damage. Side effects may include thinning of bones, weight gain and diabetes. Doctors often prescribe a corticosteroid to relieve acute symptoms, with the goal of gradually tapering off the medication. - Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These drugs can slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and save the joints and other tissues from permanent damage. Common DMARDs include methotrexate (Trexall, Otrexup, Rasuvo), leflunomide (Arava), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine). Side effects vary but may include liver damage, bone marrow suppression and severe lung infections. - Biologic agents. Also known as biologic response modifiers, this newer class of DMARDs includes abatacept (Orencia), adalimumab (Humira), anakinra (Kineret), certolizumab (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), golimumab (Simponi), infliximab (Remicade), rituximab (Rituxan), tocilizumab (Actemra) and tofacitinib (Xeljanz). These drugs can target parts of the immune system that trigger inflammation that causes joint and tissue damage. These types of drugs also increase the risk of infections. Biologic DMARDs are usually most effective when paired with a nonbiologic DMARD, such as methotrexate. Therapy Your doctor may send you to a physical or occupational therapist who can teach you exercises to help keep your joints flexible. The therapist may also suggest new ways to do daily tasks, which will be easier on your joints. For example, if your fingers are sore, you may want to pick up an object using your forearms. Assistive devices can make it easier to avoid stressing your painful joints. For instance, a kitchen knife equipped with a saw handle helps protect your finger and wrist joints. Certain tools, such as buttonhooks, can make it easier to get dressed. Catalogs and medical supply stores are good places to look for ideas. Surgery If medications fail to prevent or slow joint damage, you and your doctor may consider surgery to repair damaged joints. Surgery may help restore your ability to use your joint. It can also reduce pain and correct deformities. Rheumatoid arthritis surgery may involve one or more of the following procedures: - Synovectomy. Surgery to remove the inflamed synovium (lining of the joint). Synovectomy can be performed on knees, elbows, wrists, fingers and hips. - Tendon repair. Inflammation and joint damage may cause tendons around your joint to loosen or rupture. Your surgeon may be able to repair the tendons around your joint. - Joint fusion. Surgically fusing a joint may be recommended to stabilize or realign a joint and for pain relief when a joint replacement isn't an option. - Total joint replacement. During joint replacement surgery, your surgeon removes the damaged parts of your joint and inserts a prosthesis made of metal and plastic. Surgery carries a risk of bleeding, infection and pain. Discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor. You can take steps to care for your body if you have rheumatoid arthritis. These self-care measures, when used along with your rheumatoid arthritis medications, can help you manage your signs and symptoms: - Exercise regularly. Gentle exercise can help strengthen the muscles around your joints, and it can help fight fatigue you might feel. Check with your doctor before you start exercising. If you're just getting started, begin by taking a walk. Try swimming or gentle water aerobics. Avoid exercising tender, injured or severely inflamed joints. - Apply heat or cold. Heat can help ease your pain and relax tense, painful muscles. Cold may dull the sensation of pain. Cold also has a numbing effect and decreases muscle spasms. - Relax. Find ways to cope with pain by reducing stress in your life. Techniques such as guided imagery, distraction and muscle relaxation can all be used to control pain. Some common complementary and alternative treatments that have shown promise for rheumatoid arthritis include: - Fish oil. Some preliminary studies have found that fish oil supplements may reduce rheumatoid arthritis pain and stiffness. Side effects can include nausea, belching and a fishy taste in the mouth. Fish oil can interfere with medications, so check with your doctor first. - Plant oils. The seeds of evening primrose, borage and black currant contain a type of fatty acid that may help with rheumatoid arthritis pain and morning stiffness. Side effects may include nausea, diarrhea and gas. Some plant oils can cause liver damage or interfere with medications, so check with your doctor first. - Tai chi. This movement therapy involves gentle exercises and stretches combined with deep breathing. Many people use tai chi to relieve stress in their lives. Small studies have found that tai chi may reduce rheumatoid arthritis pain. When led by a knowledgeable instructor, tai chi is safe. But don't do any moves that cause pain."

        "document": "rheumatoid arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease that causes chronic abnormal inflammation, primarily affecting the joints. The most common signs and symptoms are pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints. Small joints in the hands and feet are involved most often, although larger joints (such as the shoulders, hips, and knees) may become involved later in the disease. Joints are typically affected in a symmetrical pattern; for example, if joints in the hand are affected, both hands tend to be involved. People with rheumatoid arthritis often report that their joint pain and stiffness is worse when getting out of bed in the morning or after a long rest.   Rheumatoid arthritis can also cause inflammation of other tissues and organs, including the eyes, lungs, and blood vessels. Additional signs and symptoms of the condition can include a loss of energy, a low fever, weight loss, and a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Some affected individuals develop rheumatoid nodules, which are firm lumps of noncancerous tissue that can grow under the skin and elsewhere in the body.   The signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis usually appear in mid- to late adulthood. Many affected people have episodes of symptoms (flares) followed by periods with no symptoms (remissions) for the rest of their lives. In severe cases, affected individuals have continuous health problems related to the disease for many years. The abnormal inflammation can lead to severe joint damage, which limits movement and can cause significant disability. Rheumatoid arthritis affects about 1.3 million adults in the United States. Worldwide, it is estimated to occur in up to 1 percent of the population. The disease is two to three times more common in women than in men, which may be related to hormonal factors. Rheumatoid arthritis probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, many of which are unknown.   Rheumatoid arthritis is classified as an autoimmune disorder, one of a large group of conditions that occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. In people with rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system triggers abnormal inflammation in the membrane that lines the joints (the synovium). When the synovium is inflamed, it causes pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joint. In severe cases, the inflammation also affects the bone, cartilage, and other tissues within the joint, causing more serious damage. Abnormal immune reactions also underlie the features of rheumatoid arthritis affecting other parts of the body.   Variations in dozens of genes have been studied as risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis. Most of these genes are known or suspected to be involved in immune system function. The most significant genetic risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis are variations in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, especially the HLA-DRB1 gene. The proteins produced from HLA genes help the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Changes in other genes appear to have a smaller impact on a person's overall risk of developing the condition.   Other, nongenetic factors are also believed to play a role in rheumatoid arthritis. These factors may trigger the condition in people who are at risk, although the mechanism is unclear. Potential triggers include changes in sex hormones (particularly in women), occupational exposure to certain kinds of dust or fibers, and viral or bacterial infections. Long-term smoking is a well-established risk factor for developing rheumatoid arthritis; it is also associated with more severe signs and symptoms in people who have the disease. The inheritance pattern of rheumatoid arthritis is unclear because many genetic and environmental factors appear to be involved. However, having a close relative with rheumatoid arthritis likely increases a person's risk of developing the condition. Carmona L, Cross M, Williams B, Lassere M, March L. Rheumatoid arthritis.

        "document": "Preeclampsia (Causes): The exact cause of preeclampsia involves several factors. Experts believe it begins in the placenta - the organ that nourishes the fetus throughout pregnancy. Early in pregnancy, new blood vessels develop and evolve to efficiently send blood to the placenta. In women with preeclampsia, these blood vessels don't seem to develop or function properly. They're narrower than normal blood vessels and react differently to hormonal signaling, which limits the amount of blood that can flow through them. Causes of this abnormal development may include: - Insufficient blood flow to the uterus   - Damage to the blood vessels   - A problem with the immune system   - Certain genes Preeclampsia is classified as one of four high blood pressure disorders that can occur during pregnancy. The other three are: - Gestational hypertension. Women with gestational hypertension have high blood pressure but no excess protein in their urine or other signs of organ damage. Some women with gestational hypertension eventually develop preeclampsia.   - Chronic hypertension. Chronic hypertension is high blood pressure that was present before pregnancy or that occurs before 20 weeks of pregnancy. But because high blood pressure usually doesn't have symptoms, it may be hard to determine when it began.   - Chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. This condition occurs in women who have been diagnosed with chronic high blood pressure before pregnancy, but then develop worsening high blood pressure and protein in the urine or other health complications during pregnancy."

        "document": "Preeclampsia (Treatment): The only cure for preeclampsia is delivery. You're at increased risk of seizures, placental abruption, stroke and possibly severe bleeding until your blood pressure decreases. Of course, if it's too early in your pregnancy, delivery may not be the best thing for your baby. If you're diagnosed with preeclampsia, your doctor will let you know how often you'll need to come in for prenatal visits - likely more frequently than what's typically recommended for pregnancy. You'll also need more frequent blood tests, ultrasounds and nonstress tests than would be expected in an uncomplicated pregnancy. Medications Possible treatment for preeclampsia may include: - Medications to lower blood pressure. These medications, called antihypertensives, are used to lower your blood pressure if it's dangerously high. Blood pressure in the 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) range generally isn't treated. Although there are many different types of antihypertensive medications, a number of them aren't safe to use during pregnancy. Discuss with your doctor whether you need to use an antihypertensive medicine in your situation to control your blood pressure. - Corticosteroids. If you have severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome, corticosteroid medications can temporarily improve liver and platelet function to help prolong your pregnancy. Corticosteroids can also help your baby's lungs become more mature in as little as 48 hours - an important step in preparing a premature baby for life outside the womb. - Anticonvulsant medications. If your preeclampsia is severe, your doctor may prescribe an anticonvulsant medication, such as magnesium sulfate, to prevent a first seizure. Bed rest Bed rest used to be routinely recommended for women with preeclampsia. But research hasn't shown a benefit from this practice, and it can increase your risk of blood clots, as well as impact your economic and social lives. For most women, bed rest is no longer recommended. Hospitalization Severe preeclampsia may require that you be hospitalized. In the hospital, your doctor may perform regular nonstress tests or biophysical profiles to monitor your baby's well-being and measure the volume of amniotic fluid. A lack of amniotic fluid is a sign of poor blood supply to the baby. Delivery If you're diagnosed with preeclampsia near the end of your pregnancy, your doctor may recommend inducing labor right away. The readiness of your cervix - whether it's beginning to open (dilate), thin (efface) and soften (ripen) - also may be a factor in determining whether or when labor will be induced. In severe cases, it may not be possible to consider your baby's gestational age or the readiness of your cervix. If it's not possible to wait, your doctor may induce labor or schedule a C-section right away. During delivery, you may be given magnesium sulfate intravenously to prevent seizures. If you need pain-relieving medication after your delivery, ask your doctor what you should take. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve), can increase your blood pressure."

Preeclampsia is more common in women who are carrying twins, triplets or other multiples.   - Interval between pregnancies. Having babies less than two years or more than 10 years apart leads to a higher risk of preeclampsia.   - History of certain conditions. Having certain conditions before you become pregnant - such as chronic high blood pressure, migraines, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, a tendency to develop blood clots, or lupus - increases your risk of preeclampsia.   - In vitro fertilization. Your risk of preeclampsia is increased if your baby was conceived with in vitro fertilization."

        "document": "Preeclampsia and Eclampsia: Preeclampsia (pree-i-KLAMP-see-uh) and eclampsia (ih-KLAMP-see-uh) are pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders. In preeclampsia, the mother\u2019s high blood pressure reduces the blood supply to the fetus, which may get less oxygen and fewer nutrients. Eclampsia is when pregnant women with preeclampsia develop seizures or coma. NICHD and other agencies are working to understand what causes these conditions and how they can be prevented and better treated. Preeclampsia and eclampsia are part of the spectrum of high blood pressure, or hypertensive, disorders that can occur during pregnancy.At the mild end of the spectrum is\u00a0gestational hypertension, which occurs when a woman who previously had normal blood pressure develops high blood pressure when she is more than 20 weeks pregnant and her blood pressure returns to normal within 12 weeks after delivery. This problem usually occurs without other symptoms. In many cases, gestational hypertension does not harm the mother or fetus. Severe gestational hypertension, however, may be associated with preterm birth and infants who are small for their age at birth.1 And about 15% to 25% of women with gestational hypertension go on to develop preeclampsia.2Preeclampsia\u00a0is similar to gestational hypertension, because it also describes high blood pressure at or after 20 weeks of pregnancy in a woman whose blood pressure was normal before pregnancy. But preeclampsia can also include blood pressure at or greater than 140/90 mmHg, increased swelling, and protein in the urine.3 The condition can be serious and is a leading cause of preterm birth (before 37 weeks of pregnancy).4 If it is severe enough to affect brain function, causing seizures or coma, it is called\u00a0eclampsia.One of the serious complications of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy is\u00a0HELLP syndrome, a situation in which a pregnant woman with preeclampsia or eclampsia suffers damage to the liver and blood cells. The letters in the name HELLP stand for the following problems:- H\u00a0-\u00a0Hemolysis, in which oxygen-carrying red blood cells break down - EL\u00a0-\u00a0Elevated\u00a0Liver enzymes, showing damage to the liver - LP\u00a0-\u00a0Low\u00a0Platelet count, meaning that the cells responsible for stopping bleeding are low The causes of preeclampsia and eclampsia are not known. These disorders previously were believed to be caused by a toxin, called \u201ctoxemia,\u201d in the blood, but health care providers now know that is not true. Nevertheless, preeclampsia is sometimes still referred to as \u201ctoxemia.\u201dTo learn more about preeclampsia and eclampsia, scientists are investigating many factors that could contribute to the development and progression of these diseases, including:- Placental abnormalities, such as insufficient blood flow - Genetic factors - Environmental exposures - Nutritional factors - Maternal immunology and autoimmune disorders - Cardiovascular and inflammatory changes - Hormonal imbalances - Risks During Pregnancy Preeclampsia during pregnancy is mild in 75% of cases.1\u00a0However, a woman can progress from mild to severe preeclampsia or to full eclampsia very quickly\u2015even in a matter of days. Both preeclampsia and eclampsia can cause serious health problems for the mother and infant. Women with preeclampsia are at increased risk for damage to the kidneys, liver, brain, and other organ and blood systems. Preeclampsia may also affect the placenta. The condition could lead to a separation of the placenta from the uterus (referred to as placental abruption),\u00a0preterm birth, and\u00a0pregnancy loss or stillbirth. In some cases, preeclampsia can lead to organ failure or stroke. In severe cases, preeclampsia can develop into eclampsia, which includes seizures. Seizures in eclampsia may cause a woman to lose consciousness and twitch uncontrollably.2\u00a0If the fetus is not delivered, these conditions can cause the death of the mother and/or the fetus. Expecting mothers rarely die from preeclampsia in the developed world, but it is still a major cause of illness and death globally.3 According to the World Health Organization, preeclampsia and eclampsia cause 14% of maternal deaths each year, or about 50,000 to 75,000 women worldwide.4 - Risks After Pregnancy In \u201cuncomplicated preeclampsia,\u201d the mother\u2019s high blood pressure and other symptoms usually go back to normal within 6 weeks of the infant\u2019s birth. However, studies have shown that women who had preeclampsia are four times more likely to later develop hypertension (high blood pressure) and are twice as likely to later develop ischemic heart disease (reduced blood supply to the heart muscle, which can cause heart attacks), a blood clot in a vein, and stroke as are women who did not have preeclampsia.5 Less commonly, mothers who had preeclampsia could experience permanent damage to their organs, such as their kidneys and liver. They could also experience fluid in the lungs. In the days following birth, women with preeclampsia remain at increased risk for developing eclampsia and seizures.3,6 Preeclampsia may be related to problems with the placenta early in the pregnancy.1 Such problems pose risks to the fetus, including:- Lack of oxygen and nutrients, which can impair fetal growth - Preterm birth - Stillbirth\u00a0if placental abruption (separation of the placenta from the uterine wall) leads to heavy bleeding in the mother - Death: According to the\u00a0Preeclampsia Foundation\u00a0, each year, about 10,500 infants in the United States and about half a million worldwide die due to preeclampsia.2\u00a0Stillbirths are more likely to occur when the mother has a more severe form of preeclampsia, including\u00a0HELLP syndrome.Infants whose mothers had preeclampsia are also at increased risk for later problems, even if they were born at full term (39 weeks of pregnancy).3 Infants born preterm due to preeclampsia face a higher risk of some long-term health issues, mostly related to being born early, including learning disorders, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, deafness, and blindness. Infants born preterm may also have to be hospitalized for a long time after birth and may be smaller than infants born full term. Infants who experienced poor growth in the uterus may later be at higher risk of\u00a0diabetes, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure.4 The exact number of women who develop preeclampsia is not known. Some estimates suggest that preeclampsia affects 2% to 8% of all pregnancies globally and about 3.4% in the United States.1,2The condition is estimated to account for 10% to 15% of maternal deaths worldwide.1 Disorders related to high blood pressure are the second leading cause of stillbirths and early neonatal deaths in developing nations.3In addition,\u00a0HELLP syndrome\u00a0occurs in about 10% to 20% of all women with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia.4Although preeclampsia occurs primarily in first pregnancies, a woman who had preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy is seven times more likely to develop preeclampsia in a later pregnancy.5Other factors that can increase a woman's risk include:5- Chronic high blood pressure or kidney disease before pregnancy - High blood pressure or preeclampsia in an earlier pregnancy - Obesity. Overweight or obese women are also more likely to have preeclampsia in more than one pregnancy.6 - Age. Women older than 40 are at higher risk. - Multiple gestation (being pregnant with more than one fetus) - African American ethnicity. Also, among women who have had preeclampsia before, non-white women are more likely than white women to develop preeclampsia again in a later pregnancy.6 - Family history of preeclampsia. According to the World Health Organization, among women who have had preeclampsia, about 20% to 40% of their daughters and 11% to 37% of their sisters also will get the disorder.7Preeclampsia is also more common among women who have histories of certain health conditions, such as migraines,8\u00a0diabetes,9 rheumatoid arthritis,10 lupus,11 scleroderma,12\u00a0urinary tract infections,13 gum disease,14\u00a0polycystic ovary syndrome,15 multiple sclerosis, gestational diabetes, and sickle cell disease.16Preeclampsia is also more common in pregnancies resulting from egg donation, donor insemination, or\u00a0in vitro\u00a0fertilization.The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends that women who are at high risk for preeclampsia take low-dose aspirin starting after 12 weeks of pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia.17 Women who are pregnant or who are thinking about getting pregnant should talk with their health care provider about preeclampsia risk and ways to reduce the risk. - Preeclampsia Possible symptoms of preeclampsia include: - High blood pressure - Too much protein in the urine - Swelling in a woman's face and hands (a woman's feet might swell too, but swollen feet are common during pregnancy and may not signal a problem) - Systemic problems, such as headache, blurred vision, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain - High blood pressure - Too much protein in the urine - Swelling in a woman's face and hands (a woman's feet might swell too, but swollen feet are common during pregnancy and may not signal a problem) - Systemic problems, such as headache, blurred vision, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain - Eclampsia The following symptoms are cause for immediate concern:1 - Seizures - Severe headache - Vision problems, such as temporary blindness - Abdominal pain, especially in the upper right area of the belly - Nausea and vomiting - Smaller urine output or not urinating very often - Seizures - Severe headache - Vision problems, such as temporary blindness - Abdominal pain, especially in the upper right area of the belly - Nausea and vomiting - Smaller urine output or not urinating very often - HELLP Syndrome HELLP syndrome\u00a0can lead to serious complications, including liver failure and death.1 A pregnant woman with HELLP syndrome might bleed or bruise easily and/or experience abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, headache, or extreme fatigue. Although most women who develop HELLP syndrome already have high blood pressure and preeclampsia, sometimes the syndrome is the first sign. In addition, HELLP syndrome can occur without a woman having either high blood pressure or protein in her urine. A health care provider will check a pregnant woman\u2019s blood pressure and urine during each\u00a0prenatal visit. If the blood pressure reading is considered high (140/90 or higher), especially after the 20th week of pregnancy, the health care provider will likely perform blood tests and more extensive lab tests to look for extra protein in the urine (called proteinuria) as well as other symptoms.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists provides the following criteria for a diagnosis of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome.Gestational hypertension\u00a0is diagnosed if a pregnant woman has high blood pressure but no protein in the urine. Gestational hypertension occurs when women whose blood pressure levels were normal before pregnancy develop high blood pressure after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Gestational hypertension can progress into preeclampsia.1Mild preeclampsia\u00a0is diagnosed when a pregnant woman has:2- Systolic blood pressure (top number) of 140 mmHg or higher or diastolic blood pressure (bottom number) of 90 mmHg or higher and either - Urine with 0.3 or more grams of protein in a 24-hour specimen (a collection of every drop of urine within 24 hours) or a protein-to-creatinine ratio greater than 0.3\u00a0 or - Blood tests that show kidney or liver dysfunction - Fluid in the lungs and difficulty breathing - Visual impairmentsSevere preeclampsia\u00a0occurs when a pregnant woman has any of the following:- Systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg or higher on two occasions at least 4 hours apart while the patient is on bed rest - Urine with 5 or more grams of protein in a 24-hour specimen or 3 or more grams of protein on 2 random urine samples collected at least 4 hours apart - Test results suggesting kidney or liver damage\u2014for example, blood tests that reveal low numbers of platelets or high liver enzymes - Severe, unexplained stomach pain that does not respond to medication - Symptoms that include visual disturbances, difficulty breathing, or fluid buildup3Eclampsia\u00a0occurs when women with preeclampsia develop seizures. The seizures can happen before or during labor or after the baby is delivered.\u00a0HELLP syndrome is diagnosed when laboratory tests show hemolysis (burst red blood cells release hemoglobin into the blood plasma), elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. There also may or may not be extra protein in the urine.4Some women may also be diagnosed with superimposed preeclampsia\u2014a situation in which the woman develops preeclampsia on top of high blood pressure that was present before she got pregnant. Health care providers look for an increase in blood pressure and either protein in the urine, fluid buildup, or both for a diagnosis of superimposed preeclampsia.In addition to tests that might diagnose preeclampsia or similar problems, health care providers may do other tests to assess the health of the mother and fetus, including:- Blood tests to see how well the mother's liver and kidneys are working - Blood tests to check blood platelet levels to see how well the mother\u2019s blood is clotting - Blood tests to count the total number of red blood cells in the mother\u2019s blood - A maternal weight check - An ultrasound to assess the fetus\u2019s size - A check of the fetus's heart rate - A physical exam to look for swelling in the mother\u2019s face, hands, or legs as well as abdominal tenderness or an enlarged liver - Preeclampsia Treatment If the pregnancy is at 37 weeks or later, the health care provider will usually want to deliver the fetus to treat preeclampsia and avoid further complications. If the pregnancy is at less than 37 weeks, however, the woman and her health care provider may consider treatment options that give the fetus more time to develop, depending on how severe the condition is. A health care provider may consider the following options: - If the preeclampsia is mild, it may be possible to wait to deliver. To help prevent further complications, the health care provider may ask the woman to go on bed rest to try to lower blood pressure and increase the blood flow to the placenta. - Close monitoring of the woman and her fetus will be needed. Tests for the mother might include blood and urine tests to see if the preeclampsia is progressing, such as tests to assess platelet counts, liver enzymes, kidney function, and urinary protein levels. Tests for the fetus might include ultrasound, heart rate monitoring, assessment of fetal growth, and amniotic fluid assessment. - Anticonvulsive medication, such as magnesium sulfate, might be used to prevent a seizure. - In some cases, such as with severe preeclampsia, the woman will be admitted to the hospital so she can be monitored closely and continuously. Treatment in the hospital might include intravenous medication to control blood pressure and prevent seizures or other complications as well as steroid injections to help speed up the development of the fetus's lungs. When a woman has severe preeclampsia and is at 34 weeks of pregnancy or later, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends delivery as soon as medically possible. If the pregnancy is at less than 34 weeks, health care providers will probably prescribe corticosteroids to help speed up the maturation of the fetal lungs before attempting delivery.2 Preterm delivery may be necessary, even if that means likely complications for the infant, because of the risk of severe maternal complications. The symptoms of preeclampsia usually go away within 6 weeks of delivery.3 - If the preeclampsia is mild, it may be possible to wait to deliver. To help prevent further complications, the health care provider may ask the woman to go on bed rest to try to lower blood pressure and increase the blood flow to the placenta. - Close monitoring of the woman and her fetus will be needed. Tests for the mother might include blood and urine tests to see if the preeclampsia is progressing, such as tests to assess platelet counts, liver enzymes, kidney function, and urinary protein levels. Tests for the fetus might include ultrasound, heart rate monitoring, assessment of fetal growth, and amniotic fluid assessment. - Anticonvulsive medication, such as magnesium sulfate, might be used to prevent a seizure. - In some cases, such as with severe preeclampsia, the woman will be admitted to the hospital so she can be monitored closely and continuously. Treatment in the hospital might include intravenous medication to control blood pressure and prevent seizures or other complications as well as steroid injections to help speed up the development of the fetus's lungs. - Eclampsia Treatment Eclampsia\u2014the onset of seizures in a woman with preeclampsia\u2014is considered a medical emergency. Immediate treatment, usually in a hospital, is needed to stop the mother's seizures, treat blood pressure levels that are too high, and deliver the fetus. Magnesium sulfate (a type of mineral) may be given to treat active seizures and prevent future seizures. Antihypertensive medications may be given to lower the blood pressure. - HELLP Syndrome Treatment HELLP syndrome, a severe complication of preeclampsia and eclampsia, can lead to serious complications for the mother, including liver failure and death, as well as the fetus. The health care provider may consider the following treatments after a diagnosis of HELLP syndrome: - Delivery of the fetus - Hospitalization to provide intravenous medication to control blood pressure and prevent seizures or other complications as well as steroid injections to help speed up the development of the fetus's lungs.4 - Delivery of the fetus - Hospitalization to provide intravenous medication to control blood pressure and prevent seizures or other complications as well as steroid injections to help speed up the development of the fetus's lungs.4 - If I have high blood pressure, can I take steps to prevent problems like preeclampsia during pregnancy? If you currently have chronic hypertension (high blood pressure not due to pregnancy), you may be at higher-than-average risk for getting preeclampsia during pregnancy. Your risk is also higher if you had gestational hypertension (high blood pressure that occurs only during pregnancy) or preeclampsia with a previous pregnancy, if you are obese, or if you have other risk factors.1 Talk with your health care provider about how hypertension might affect your pregnancy and what you can do to lower your risk. Before You Get Pregnant - Visit your health care provider for a\u00a0preconception visit\u00a0to discuss what you can do to lower your risk. Your health care provider may recommend ways to control your blood pressure, if needed, by limiting your salt intake, exercising regularly, and losing weight if you are overweight. - If you take medication to control your blood pressure, ask your health care provider if you should change it. Some medications should not be used during pregnancy. Your health care provider may be able to recommend safer alternatives. While You Are Pregnant - Get regular prenatal care, including regular blood pressure checks, urine tests for protein, as well as regular weight checks. - Avoid alcohol and tobacco. - Talk with your health care provider about any drugs or supplements that you take or are thinking of taking, including vitamins and herbs. Follow your provider's recommendations about prescription and other medications. - If you are at very high risk of preeclampsia, your doctor may recommend that you start taking low-dose aspirin after at least 12 weeks of pregnancy.2 [top] - Visit your health care provider for a\u00a0preconception visit\u00a0to discuss what you can do to lower your risk.

Having severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome during the first pregnancy also raises your risk. If you had HELLP syndrome during a pregnancy, you have about a 20% chance of getting some form of gestational hypertension again.4 [top]"

        "document": "Preeclampsia: Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys. Preeclampsia usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure had been normal. Even a slight rise in blood pressure may be a sign of preeclampsia. Left untreated, preeclampsia can lead to serious - even fatal - complications for both you and your baby. If you have preeclampsia, the only cure is delivery of your baby. If you're diagnosed with preeclampsia too early in your pregnancy to deliver your baby, you and your doctor face a challenging task. Your baby needs more time to mature, but you need to avoid putting yourself or your baby at risk of serious complications. Preeclampsia sometimes develops without any symptoms. High blood pressure may develop slowly, or it may have a sudden onset. Monitoring your blood pressure is an important part of prenatal care because the first sign of preeclampsia is commonly a rise in blood pressure. Blood pressure that exceeds 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or greater - documented on two occasions, at least four hours apart - is abnormal. Other signs and symptoms of preeclampsia may include: - Excess protein in your urine (proteinuria) or additional signs of kidney problems   - Severe headaches   - Changes in vision, including temporary loss of vision, blurred vision or light sensitivity   - Upper abdominal pain, usually under your ribs on the right side   - Nausea or vomiting   - Decreased urine output   - Decreased levels of platelets in your blood (thrombocytopenia)   - Impaired liver function   - Shortness of breath, caused by fluid in your lungs Sudden weight gain and swelling (edema) - particularly in your face and hands - may occur with preeclampsia. But these also occur in many normal pregnancies, so they're not considered reliable signs of preeclampsia. Make sure you attend your prenatal visits so that your care provider can monitor your blood pressure. Contact your doctor immediately or go to an emergency room if you have severe headaches, blurred vision or other visual disturbance, severe pain in your abdomen, or severe shortness of breath. Because headaches, nausea, and aches and pains are common pregnancy complaints, it's difficult to know when new symptoms are simply part of being pregnant and when they may indicate a serious problem - especially if it's your first pregnancy. If you're concerned about your symptoms, contact your doctor. The exact cause of preeclampsia involves several factors. Experts believe it begins in the placenta - the organ that nourishes the fetus throughout pregnancy. Early in pregnancy, new blood vessels develop and evolve to efficiently send blood to the placenta. In women with preeclampsia, these blood vessels don't seem to develop or function properly. They're narrower than normal blood vessels and react differently to hormonal signaling, which limits the amount of blood that can flow through them. Causes of this abnormal development may include: - Insufficient blood flow to the uterus   - Damage to the blood vessels   - A problem with the immune system   - Certain genes Preeclampsia is classified as one of four high blood pressure disorders that can occur during pregnancy. The other three are: - Gestational hypertension. Women with gestational hypertension have high blood pressure but no excess protein in their urine or other signs of organ damage. Some women with gestational hypertension eventually develop preeclampsia.   - Chronic hypertension. Chronic hypertension is high blood pressure that was present before pregnancy or that occurs before 20 weeks of pregnancy. But because high blood pressure usually doesn't have symptoms, it may be hard to determine when it began.   - Chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. This condition occurs in women who have been diagnosed with chronic high blood pressure before pregnancy, but then develop worsening high blood pressure and protein in the urine or other health complications during pregnancy. Preeclampsia develops only as a complication of pregnancy. Risk factors include: - History of preeclampsia. A personal or family history of preeclampsia significantly raises your risk of preeclampsia.   - Chronic hypertension. If you already have chronic hypertension, you have a higher risk of developing preeclampsia.   - First pregnancy. The risk of developing preeclampsia is highest during your first pregnancy.   - New paternity. Each pregnancy with a new partner increases the risk of preeclampsia more than does a second or third pregnancy with the same partner.   - Age. The risk of preeclampsia is higher for very young pregnant women as well as pregnant women older than 40.   - Obesity. The risk of preeclampsia is higher if you're obese.   - Multiple pregnancy. Preeclampsia is more common in women who are carrying twins, triplets or other multiples.   - Interval between pregnancies. Having babies less than two years or more than 10 years apart leads to a higher risk of preeclampsia.   - History of certain conditions. Having certain conditions before you become pregnant - such as chronic high blood pressure, migraines, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, a tendency to develop blood clots, or lupus - increases your risk of preeclampsia.   - In vitro fertilization. Your risk of preeclampsia is increased if your baby was conceived with in vitro fertilization. The more severe your preeclampsia and the earlier it occurs in your pregnancy, the greater the risks for you and your baby. Preeclampsia may require induced labor and delivery. Delivery by cesarean delivery (C-section) may be necessary if there are clinical or obstetric conditions that require a speedy delivery. Your obstetric provider will assist you in deciding what type of delivery is correct for your condition. Complications of preeclampsia may include: - Fetal growth restriction. Preeclampsia affects the arteries carrying blood to the placenta. If the placenta doesn't get enough blood, your baby may receive inadequate blood and oxygen and fewer nutrients. This can lead to slow growth known as fetal growth restriction, low birth weight or preterm birth.   - Preterm birth. If you have preeclampsia with severe features, you may need to be delivered early, to save the life of you and your baby. Prematurity can lead to breathing and other problems for your baby. Your health care provider will help you understand when is the ideal time for your delivery.   - Placental abruption. Preeclampsia increases your risk of placental abruption, a condition in which the placenta separates from the inner wall of your uterus before delivery. Severe abruption can cause heavy bleeding, which can be life-threatening for both you and your baby.   -   HELLP syndrome. HELLP - which stands for hemolysis (the destruction of red blood cells), elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count - syndrome is a more severe form of preeclampsia, and can rapidly become life-threatening for both you and your baby.  Symptoms of HELLP syndrome include nausea and vomiting, headache, and upper right abdominal pain. HELLP syndrome is particularly dangerous because it represents damage to several organ systems. On occasion, it may develop suddenly, even before high blood pressure is detected or it may develop without any symptoms at all.    -   Eclampsia. When preeclampsia isn't controlled, eclampsia - which is essentially preeclampsia plus seizures - can develop. It is very difficult to predict which patients will have preeclampsia that is severe enough to result in eclampsia.  Often, there are no symptoms or warning signs to predict eclampsia. Because eclampsia can have serious consequences for both mom and baby, delivery becomes necessary, regardless of how far along the pregnancy is.    - Other organ damage. Preeclampsia may result in kidney, liver, lung, heart, or eyes, and may cause a stroke or other brain injury. The amount of injury to other organs depends on the severity of preeclampsia.   - Cardiovascular disease. Having preeclampsia may increase your risk of future heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. The risk is even greater if you've had preeclampsia more than once or you've had a preterm delivery. To minimize this risk, after delivery try to maintain your ideal weight, eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, exercise regularly, and don't smoke. To diagnose preeclampsia, you have to have high blood pressure and one or more of the following complications after the 20th week of pregnancy: - Protein in your urine (proteinuria) - A low platelet count - Impaired liver function - Signs of kidney trouble other than protein in the urine - Fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) - New-onset headaches or visual disturbances Previously, preeclampsia was only diagnosed if high blood pressure and protein in the urine were present. However, experts now know that it's possible to have preeclampsia, yet never have protein in the urine. A blood pressure reading in excess of 140/90 mm Hg is abnormal in pregnancy. However, a single high blood pressure reading doesn't mean you have preeclampsia. If you have one reading in the abnormal range - or a reading that's substantially higher than your usual blood pressure - your doctor will closely observe your numbers. Having a second abnormal blood pressure reading four hours after the first may confirm your doctor's suspicion of preeclampsia. Your doctor may have you come in for additional blood pressure readings and blood and urine tests. Tests that may be needed If your doctor suspects preeclampsia, you may need certain tests, including: - Blood tests. Your doctor will order liver function tests, kidney function tests and also measure your platelets - the cells that help blood clot. - Urine analysis. Your doctor will ask you to collect your urine for 24 hours, for measurement of the amount of protein in your urine. A single urine sample that measures the ratio of protein to creatinine - a chemical that's always present in the urine - also may be used to make the diagnosis. - Fetal ultrasound. Your doctor may also recommend close monitoring of your baby's growth, typically through ultrasound. The images of your baby created during the ultrasound exam allow your doctor to estimate fetal weight and the amount of fluid in the uterus (amniotic fluid). - Nonstress test or biophysical profile. A nonstress test is a simple procedure that checks how your baby's heart rate reacts when your baby moves. A biophysical profile uses an ultrasound to measure your baby's breathing, muscle tone, movement and the volume of amniotic fluid in your uterus. The only cure for preeclampsia is delivery. You're at increased risk of seizures, placental abruption, stroke and possibly severe bleeding until your blood pressure decreases. Of course, if it's too early in your pregnancy, delivery may not be the best thing for your baby. If you're diagnosed with preeclampsia, your doctor will let you know how often you'll need to come in for prenatal visits - likely more frequently than what's typically recommended for pregnancy. You'll also need more frequent blood tests, ultrasounds and nonstress tests than would be expected in an uncomplicated pregnancy. Medications Possible treatment for preeclampsia may include: - Medications to lower blood pressure. These medications, called antihypertensives, are used to lower your blood pressure if it's dangerously high. Blood pressure in the 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) range generally isn't treated. Although there are many different types of antihypertensive medications, a number of them aren't safe to use during pregnancy. Discuss with your doctor whether you need to use an antihypertensive medicine in your situation to control your blood pressure. - Corticosteroids. If you have severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome, corticosteroid medications can temporarily improve liver and platelet function to help prolong your pregnancy. Corticosteroids can also help your baby's lungs become more mature in as little as 48 hours - an important step in preparing a premature baby for life outside the womb. - Anticonvulsant medications. If your preeclampsia is severe, your doctor may prescribe an anticonvulsant medication, such as magnesium sulfate, to prevent a first seizure. Bed rest Bed rest used to be routinely recommended for women with preeclampsia. But research hasn't shown a benefit from this practice, and it can increase your risk of blood clots, as well as impact your economic and social lives. For most women, bed rest is no longer recommended. Hospitalization Severe preeclampsia may require that you be hospitalized. In the hospital, your doctor may perform regular nonstress tests or biophysical profiles to monitor your baby's well-being and measure the volume of amniotic fluid. A lack of amniotic fluid is a sign of poor blood supply to the baby. Delivery If you're diagnosed with preeclampsia near the end of your pregnancy, your doctor may recommend inducing labor right away. The readiness of your cervix - whether it's beginning to open (dilate), thin (efface) and soften (ripen) - also may be a factor in determining whether or when labor will be induced. In severe cases, it may not be possible to consider your baby's gestational age or the readiness of your cervix. If it's not possible to wait, your doctor may induce labor or schedule a C-section right away. During delivery, you may be given magnesium sulfate intravenously to prevent seizures. If you need pain-relieving medication after your delivery, ask your doctor what you should take.

        "document": "Preeclampsia and Eclampsia (How many women are affected by or at risk of preeclampsia?): The exact number of women who develop preeclampsia is not known. Some estimates suggest that preeclampsia affects 2% to 8% of all pregnancies globally and about 3.4% in the United States.1,2The condition is estimated to account for 10% to 15% of maternal deaths worldwide.1 Disorders related to high blood pressure are the second leading cause of stillbirths and early neonatal deaths in developing nations.3In addition,\u00a0HELLP syndrome\u00a0occurs in about 10% to 20% of all women with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia.4Although preeclampsia occurs primarily in first pregnancies, a woman who had preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy is seven times more likely to develop preeclampsia in a later pregnancy.5Other factors that can increase a woman's risk include:5- Chronic high blood pressure or kidney disease before pregnancy - High blood pressure or preeclampsia in an earlier pregnancy - Obesity. Overweight or obese women are also more likely to have preeclampsia in more than one pregnancy.6 - Age. Women older than 40 are at higher risk. - Multiple gestation (being pregnant with more than one fetus) - African American ethnicity. Also, among women who have had preeclampsia before, non-white women are more likely than white women to develop preeclampsia again in a later pregnancy.6 - Family history of preeclampsia. According to the World Health Organization, among women who have had preeclampsia, about 20% to 40% of their daughters and 11% to 37% of their sisters also will get the disorder.7Preeclampsia is also more common among women who have histories of certain health conditions, such as migraines,8\u00a0diabetes,9 rheumatoid arthritis,10 lupus,11 scleroderma,12\u00a0urinary tract infections,13 gum disease,14\u00a0polycystic ovary syndrome,15 multiple sclerosis, gestational diabetes, and sickle cell disease.16Preeclampsia is also more common in pregnancies resulting from egg donation, donor insemination, or\u00a0in vitro\u00a0fertilization.The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends that women who are at high risk for preeclampsia take low-dose aspirin starting after 12 weeks of pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia.17 Women who are pregnant or who are thinking about getting pregnant should talk with their health care provider about preeclampsia risk and ways to reduce the risk."

        "document": "Leukemia (Treatment): Treatment for your leukemia depends on many factors. Your doctor determines your leukemia treatment options based on your age and overall health, the type of leukemia you have, and whether it has spread to other parts of your body, including the central nervous system. Common treatments used to fight leukemia include: - Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the major form of treatment for leukemia. This drug treatment uses chemicals to kill leukemia cells. Depending on the type of leukemia you have, you may receive a single drug or a combination of drugs. These drugs may come in a pill form, or they may be injected directly into a vein. - Biological therapy. Biological therapy works by using treatments that help your immune system recognize and attack leukemia cells. - Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs that attack specific vulnerabilities within your cancer cells. For example, the drug imatinib (Gleevec) stops the action of a protein within the leukemia cells of people with chronic myelogenous leukemia. This can help control the disease. - Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses X-rays or other high-energy beams to damage leukemia cells and stop their growth. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a large machine moves around you, directing the radiation to precise points on your body. You may receive radiation in one specific area of your body where there is a collection of leukemia cells, or you may receive radiation over your whole body. Radiation therapy may be used to prepare for a stem cell transplant. - Stem cell transplant. A stem cell transplant is a procedure to replace your diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow. Before a stem cell transplant, you receive high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your diseased bone marrow. Then you receive an infusion of blood-forming stem cells that help to rebuild your bone marrow. You may receive stem cells from a donor, or in some cases you may be able to use your own stem cells. A stem cell transplant is very similar to a bone marrow transplant."

        "document": "Psoriasis: Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes skin redness and irritation. Most people with psoriasis have thick, red skin with flaky, silver-white patches called scales. Psoriasis is very common. Anyone can develop it, but it most often begins between ages 15 to 35.   Psoriasis isn't contagious. This means it doesn't spread to other people.   Psoriasis seems to be passed down through families. Health care providers think it may be an autoimmune condition. This occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and inflames or destroys healthy body tissue.    Normal skin cells grow deep in the skin and rise to the surface about once a month. When you have psoriasis, this process takes place in 2 weeks rather than in 3 to 4 weeks. This results in dead skin cells building up on the skin's surface, forming the patches of scales.   The following may trigger an attack of psoriasis or make it harder to treat:     - Infections from bacteria or viruses, including strep throat and upper respiratory infections   - Dry air or dry skin   - Injury to the skin, including cuts, burns, and insect bites   - Some medicines, including antimalaria drugs, beta-blockers, and lithium   - Stress   - Too little sunlight   - Too much sunlight (sunburn)   - Drinking too much alcohol      Psoriasis may be worse in people who have a weak immune system. This may be due to:     - AIDS   - Autoimmune disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis)   - Cancer chemotherapy      Some people with psoriasis also have arthritis (psoriatic arthritis). Psoriasis can appear suddenly or slowly. Many times, it goes away and then comes back.   The main symptom of the condition is irritated, red, flaky patches of skin. The medical term for the patches is plaques. Plaques are most often seen on the elbows, knees, and middle of the body. But they can appear anywhere, including on the scalp, palms, and soles of the feet.   The skin may be:     - Itchy   - Dry and covered with silver, flaky skin (scales)   - Pink-red in color (like the color of salmon)   - Raised and thick      Other symptoms may include:     - Genital sores in males   - Joint pain or aching   - Nail changes, including thick nails, yellow-brown nails, dents in the nail, and a lifting of the nail from the skin underneath   - Severe dandruff on the scalp        There are 5 main types of psoriasis:     - Erythrodermic. The skin redness is very intense and covers a large area.   - Guttate. Small, pink-red spots appear on the skin. This form seems to be linked to strep infections.   - Inverse. Skin redness and irritation occur in the armpits, groin, and in between overlapping skin.   - Plaque. Thick, red patches of skin are covered by flaky, silver-white scales. This is the most common type of psoriasis.   - Pustular. White pus-filled blisters (pustules) are surrounded by red, irritated skin. Your provider can usually diagnose this condition by looking at your skin.    Sometimes, a skin biopsy is done to rule out other possible conditions. If you have joint pain, your provider may order x-rays. The goal of treatment is to control your symptoms and prevent infection.   Three treatment options are available:     - Skin lotions, ointments, creams, and shampoos.

Some people may benefit from a psoriasis support group. The National Psoriasis Foundation is a good resource: www.psoriasis.org. Psoriasis can be a lifelong condition that can be controlled with treatment. It may go away for a long time and then return. With proper treatment, it will not affect your overall health. But be aware that there is a strong link between psoriasis and other health problems, such as heart disease. Call your provider if you have symptoms of psoriasis or if your skin irritation continues despite treatment.   Tell your provider if you have joint pain or fever with your psoriasis attacks.    If you have symptoms of arthritis, talk to your dermatologist or rheumatologist.   Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have a severe outbreak that covers all or most of your body. There is no known way to prevent psoriasis. Keeping the skin clean and moist and avoiding your psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups.   Providers recommend daily baths or showers for people with psoriasis. Avoid scrubbing too hard, because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack. Updated by: Kevin Berman, MD, PhD, Atlanta Center for Dermatologic Disease, Atlanta, GA.

Here are a few examples: - Plaque psoriasis, which causes patches of skin that are red at the base and covered by silvery scales. - Guttate psoriasis, which causes small, drop-shaped lesions on your trunk, limbs, and scalp. This type of psoriasis is most often triggered by upper respiratory infections, such as strep throat. - Pustular psoriasis, which causes pus-filled blisters. Attacks or flares can be caused by medications, infections, stress, or certain chemicals. - Inverse psoriasis, which causes smooth, red patches in folds of skin near the genitals, under the breasts or in the armpits. Rubbing and sweating can make this type of psoriasis worse. - Erythrodermic psoriasis, which causes red and scaly skin over much of your body. This can be a reaction to a bad sunburn or taking certain medications, such as corticosteroids. It can also happen if you have a different type of psoriasis that is not well controlled. This type of psoriasis can be very serious, so if you have it, you should see a doctor immediately. There are several different types of psoriasis.

Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease, which means that your body\u2019s immune system \u2013 which protects you from diseases \u2013 starts overacting and causing problems. If you have psoriasis, a type of white blood cells called the T cells become so active that they trigger other immune system responses, including swelling and fast turnover of skin cells. Your skin cells grow deep in the skin and rise slowly to the surface. This is called cell turnover, and it usually takes about a month. If you have psoriasis, though, cell turnover can take only a few days. Your skin cells rise too fast and pile up on the surface, causing your skin to look red and scaly. Some things may cause a flare, meaning your psoriasis becomes worse for a while, including: - Infections. - Stress. - Changes in the weather that dry out your skin. - Certain medicines. - Cuts, scratches or sunburns.

        "document": "Psoriasis: Psoriasis is a common skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells. It causes cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful. Psoriasis is a chronic disease that often comes and goes. The main goal of treatment is to stop the skin cells from growing so quickly. There is no cure for psoriasis, but you can manage symptoms. Lifestyle measures, such as moisturizing, quitting smoking and managing stress, may help. Psoriasis care at Mayo Clinic Psoriasis signs and symptoms are different for everyone. Common signs and symptoms include: - Red patches of skin covered with thick, silvery scales   - Small scaling spots (commonly seen in children)   - Dry, cracked skin that may bleed   - Itching, burning or soreness   - Thickened, pitted or ridged nails   - Swollen and stiff joints Psoriasis patches can range from a few spots of dandruff-like scaling to major eruptions that cover large areas. Most types of psoriasis go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a time or even going into complete remission. There are several types of psoriasis. These include: - Plaque psoriasis. The most common form, plaque psoriasis causes dry, raised, red skin lesions (plaques) covered with silvery scales. The plaques might be itchy or painful and there may be few or many. They can occur anywhere on your body, including your genitals and the soft tissue inside your mouth.   - Nail psoriasis. Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Psoriatic nails might loosen and separate from the nail bed (onycholysis). Severe cases may cause the nail to crumble.   -  Guttate psoriasis. This type primarily affects young adults and children. It's usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throat. It's marked by small, water-drop-shaped, scaling lesions on your trunk, arms, legs and scalp.  The lesions are covered by a fine scale and aren't as thick as typical plaques are. You may have a single outbreak that goes away on its own, or you may have repeated episodes.    - Inverse psoriasis. This mainly affects the skin in the armpits, in the groin, under the breasts and around the genitals. Inverse psoriasis causes smooth patches of red, inflamed skin that worsen with friction and sweating. Fungal infections may trigger this type of psoriasis.   -  Pustular psoriasis. This uncommon form of psoriasis can occur in widespread patches (generalized pustular psoriasis) or in smaller areas on your hands, feet or fingertips.  It generally develops quickly, with pus-filled blisters appearing just hours after your skin becomes red and tender. The blisters may come and go frequently. Generalized pustular psoriasis can also cause fever, chills, severe itching and diarrhea.    - Erythrodermic psoriasis. The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover your entire body with a red, peeling rash that can itch or burn intensely.   - Psoriatic arthritis. In addition to inflamed, scaly skin, psoriatic arthritis causes swollen, painful joints that are typical of arthritis. Sometimes the joint symptoms are the first or only manifestation of psoriasis or at times only nail changes are seen. Symptoms range from mild to severe, and psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint. Although the disease usually isn't as crippling as other forms of arthritis, it can cause stiffness and progressive joint damage that in the most serious cases may lead to permanent deformity. If you suspect that you may have psoriasis, see your doctor for an examination. Also, talk to your doctor if your psoriasis: - Causes you discomfort and pain   - Makes performing routine tasks difficult   - Causes you concern about the appearance of your skin   - Leads to joint problems, such as pain, swelling or inability to perform daily tasks Seek medical advice if your signs and symptoms worsen or don't improve with treatment. You may need a different medication or a combination of treatments to manage the psoriasis. The cause of psoriasis isn't fully understood, but it's thought to be related to an immune system problem with T cells and other white blood cells, called neutrophils, in your body. T cells normally travel through the body to defend against foreign substances, such as viruses or bacteria. But if you have psoriasis, the T cells attack healthy skin cells by mistake, as if to heal a wound or to fight an infection. Overactive T cells also trigger increased production of healthy skin cells, more T cells and other white blood cells, especially neutrophils. These travel into the skin causing redness and sometimes pus in pustular lesions. Dilated blood vessels in psoriasis-affected areas create warmth and redness in the skin lesions. The process becomes an ongoing cycle in which new skin cells move to the outermost layer of skin too quickly - in days rather than weeks. Skin cells build up in thick, scaly patches on the skin's surface, continuing until treatment stops the cycle. Just what causes T cells to malfunction in people with psoriasis isn't entirely clear. Researchers believe both genetics and environmental factors play a role. Psoriasis typically starts or worsens because of a trigger that you may be able to identify and avoid. Factors that may trigger psoriasis include: - Infections, such as strep throat or skin infections   - Injury to the skin, such as a cut or scrape, a bug bite, or a severe sunburn   - Stress   - Smoking   - Heavy alcohol consumption   - Vitamin D deficiency   - Certain medications - including lithium, which is prescribed for bipolar disorder, high blood pressure medications such as beta blockers, antimalarial drugs, and iodides Anyone can develop psoriasis, but these factors can increase your risk of developing the disease: - Family history. This is one of the most significant risk factors. Having one parent with psoriasis increases your risk of getting the disease, and having two parents with psoriasis increases your risk even more.   - Viral and bacterial infections. People with HIV are more likely to develop psoriasis than people with healthy immune systems are. Children and young adults with recurring infections, particularly strep throat, also may be at increased risk.   - Stress. Because stress can impact your immune system, high stress levels may increase your risk of psoriasis.   - Obesity. Excess weight increases the risk of psoriasis. Lesions (plaques) associated with all types of psoriasis often develop in skin creases and folds.   - Smoking. Smoking tobacco not only increases your risk of psoriasis but also may increase the severity of the disease. Smoking may also play a role in the initial development of the disease. In most cases, diagnosis of psoriasis is fairly straightforward. - Physical exam and medical history. Your doctor usually can diagnose psoriasis by taking your medical history and examining your skin, scalp and nails. - Skin biopsy. Rarely, your doctor may take a small sample of skin (biopsy). He or she will likely first apply a local anesthetic. The sample is examined under a microscope to determine the exact type of psoriasis and to rule out other disorders. Psoriasis treatments reduce inflammation and clear the skin. Treatments can be divided into three main types: topical treatments, light therapy and systemic medications. Topical treatments Used alone, creams and ointments that you apply to your skin can effectively treat mild to moderate psoriasis. When the disease is more severe, creams are likely to be combined with oral medications or light therapy. Topical psoriasis treatments include: - Topical corticosteroids. These drugs are the most frequently prescribed medications for treating mild to moderate psoriasis. They reduce inflammation and relieve itching and may be used with other treatments. Mild corticosteroid ointments are usually recommended for sensitive areas, such as your face or skin folds, and for treating widespread patches of damaged skin. Your doctor may prescribe stronger corticosteroid ointment for smaller, less sensitive or tougher-to-treat areas. Long-term use or overuse of strong corticosteroids can cause thinning of the skin. Topical corticosteroids may stop working over time. It's usually best to use topical corticosteroids as a short-term treatment during flares. - Vitamin D analogues. These synthetic forms of vitamin D slow skin cell growth. Calcipotriene (Dovonex) is a prescription cream or solution containing a vitamin D analogue that treats mild to moderate psoriasis along with other treatments. Calcipotriene might irritate your skin. Calcitriol (Vectical) is expensive but may be equally effective and possibly less irritating than calcipotriene. - Anthralin. This medication helps slow skin cell growth. Anthralin (Dritho-Scalp) can also remove scales and make skin smoother. But anthralin can irritate skin, and it stains almost anything it touches. It's usually applied for a short time and then washed off. - Topical retinoids. These are vitamin A derivatives that may decrease inflammation. The most common side effect is skin irritation. These medications may also increase sensitivity to sunlight, so while using the medication apply sunscreen before going outdoors. The risk of birth defects is far lower for topical retinoids than for oral retinoids. But tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage) isn't recommended when you're pregnant or breast-feeding or if you intend to become pregnant. - Calcineurin inhibitors. Calcineurin inhibitors - tacrolimus (Prograf) and pimecrolimus (Elidel) - reduce inflammation and plaque buildup. Calcineurin inhibitors are not recommended for long-term or continuous use because of a potential increased risk of skin cancer and lymphoma. They may be especially helpful in areas of thin skin, such as around the eyes, where steroid creams or retinoids are too irritating or may cause harmful effects. - Salicylic acid. Available over-the-counter (nonprescription) and by prescription, salicylic acid promotes sloughing of dead skin cells and reduces scaling. Sometimes it's combined with other medications, such as topical corticosteroids or coal tar, to increase its effectiveness. Salicylic acid is available in medicated shampoos and scalp solutions to treat scalp psoriasis. - Coal tar. Derived from coal, coal tar reduces scaling, itching and inflammation. Coal tar can irritate the skin. It's also messy, stains clothing and bedding, and has a strong odor. Coal tar is available in over-the-counter shampoos, creams and oils. It's also available in higher concentrations by prescription. This treatment isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. - Moisturizers. Moisturizing creams alone won't heal psoriasis, but they can reduce itching, scaling and dryness. Moisturizers in an ointment base are usually more effective than are lighter creams and lotions. Apply immediately after a bath or shower to lock in moisture. Light therapy (phototherapy) This treatment uses natural or artificial ultraviolet light. The simplest and easiest form of phototherapy involves exposing your skin to controlled amounts of natural sunlight. Other forms of light therapy include the use of artificial ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light, either alone or in combination with medications. - Sunlight. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight or artificial light slows skin cell turnover and reduces scaling and inflammation. Brief, daily exposures to small amounts of sunlight may improve psoriasis, but intense sun exposure can worsen symptoms and cause skin damage. Before beginning a sunlight regimen, ask your doctor about the safest way to use natural sunlight for psoriasis treatment. - UVB phototherapy. Controlled doses of UVB light from an artificial light source may improve mild to moderate psoriasis symptoms. UVB phototherapy, also called broadband UVB, can be used to treat single patches, widespread psoriasis and psoriasis that resists topical treatments. Short-term side effects may include redness, itching and dry skin. Using a moisturizer may help decrease these side effects. - Narrow band UVB phototherapy. A newer type of psoriasis treatment, narrow band UVB phototherapy may be more effective than broadband UVB treatment. It's usually administered two or three times a week until the skin improves, and then maintenance may require only weekly sessions. Narrow band UVB phototherapy may cause more-severe and longer lasting burns, however. - Goeckerman therapy. Some doctors combine UVB treatment and coal tar treatment, which is known as Goeckerman treatment. The two therapies together are more effective than either alone because coal tar makes skin more receptive to UVB light. - Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). This form of photochemotherapy involves taking a light-sensitizing medication (psoralen) before exposure to UVA light. UVA light penetrates deeper into the skin than does UVB light, and psoralen makes the skin more responsive to UVA exposure. This more aggressive treatment consistently improves skin and is often used for more-severe cases of psoriasis. Short-term side effects include nausea, headache, burning and itching. Long-term side effects include dry and wrinkled skin, freckles, increased sun sensitivity, and increased risk of skin cancer, including melanoma. - Excimer laser. This form of light therapy, used for mild to moderate psoriasis, treats only the involved skin without harming healthy skin. A controlled beam of UVB light is directed to the psoriasis plaques to control scaling and inflammation. Excimer laser therapy requires fewer sessions than does traditional phototherapy because more powerful UVB light is used. Side effects can include redness and blistering. Oral or injected medications If you have severe psoriasis or it's resistant to other types of treatment, your doctor may prescribe oral or injected drugs. This is known as systemic treatment. Because of severe side effects, some of these medications are used for only brief periods and may be alternated with other forms of treatment. - Retinoids. Related to vitamin A, this group of drugs may help if you have severe psoriasis that doesn't respond to other therapies. Side effects may include lip inflammation and hair loss. And because retinoids such as acitretin (Soriatane) can cause severe birth defects, women must avoid pregnancy for at least three years after taking the medication. - Methotrexate. Taken orally, methotrexate (Rheumatrex) helps psoriasis by decreasing the production of skin cells and suppressing inflammation. It may also slow the progression of psoriatic arthritis in some people. Methotrexate is generally well-tolerated in low doses but may cause upset stomach, loss of appetite and fatigue. When used for long periods, it can cause a number of serious side effects, including severe liver damage and decreased production of red and white blood cells and platelets. - Cyclosporine. Cyclosporine (Gengraf, Neoral) suppresses the immune system and is similar to methotrexate in effectiveness, but can only be taken short-term. Like other immunosuppressant drugs, cyclosporine increases your risk of infection and other health problems, including cancer. Cyclosporine also makes you more susceptible to kidney problems and high blood pressure - the risk increases with higher dosages and long-term therapy. - Drugs that alter the immune system (biologics). Several of these drugs are approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. They include etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), ustekinumab (Stelara), golimumab (Simponi), apremilast (Otezla), secukinumab (Cosentyx) and ixekizumab (Taltz). Most of these drugs are given by injection (apremilast is oral) and are usually used for people who have failed to respond to traditional therapy or who have associated psoriatic arthritis. Biologics must be used with caution because they have strong effects on the immune system and may permit life-threatening infections. In particular, people taking these treatments must be screened for tuberculosis. - Other medications. Thioguanine (Tabloid) and hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) are medications that can be used when other drugs can't be given. Treatment considerations Although doctors choose treatments based on the type and severity of psoriasis and the areas of skin affected, the traditional approach is to start with the mildest treatments - topical creams and ultraviolet light therapy (phototherapy) - in those patients with typical skin lesions (plaques) and then progress to stronger ones only if necessary. Patients with pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis or associated arthritis usually need systemic therapy from the beginning of treatment. The goal is to find the most effective way to slow cell turnover with the fewest possible side effects. Potential future treatments There are a number of new medications currently being researched that have the potential to improve psoriasis treatment. These treatments target different proteins that work with the immune system. Alternative medicine A number of alternative therapies claim to ease the symptoms of psoriasis, including special diets, creams, dietary supplements and herbs. None have definitively been proved effective. But some alternative therapies are deemed generally safe, and they may be helpful to some people in reducing signs and symptoms, such as itching and scaling. These treatments would be most appropriate for those with milder, plaque disease and not for those with pustules, erythroderma or arthritis. - Aloe vera. Taken from the leaves of the aloe vera plant, aloe extract cream may reduce redness, scaling, itching and inflammation. You may need to use the cream several times a day for a month or more to see any improvements in your skin. - Fish oil. Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil supplements may reduce inflammation associated with psoriasis, although results from studies are mixed. Taking 3 grams or less of fish oil daily is generally recognized as safe, and you may find it beneficial. - Oregon grape. Also known as barberry, topical applications of Oregon grape may reduce inflammation and ease psoriasis symptoms. If you're considering dietary supplements or other alternative therapy to ease the symptoms of psoriasis, consult your doctor. He or she can help you weigh the pros and cons of specific alternative therapies. Although self-help measures won't cure psoriasis, they may help improve the appearance and feel of damaged skin. These measures may benefit you: - Take daily baths. Bathing daily helps remove scales and calm inflamed skin. Add bath oil, colloidal oatmeal, Epsom salts or Dead Sea salts to the water and soak. Avoid hot water and harsh soaps, which can worsen symptoms; use lukewarm water and mild soaps that have added oils and fats. Soak about 10 minutes then gently pat dry skin. - Use moisturizer. After bathing, apply a heavy, ointment-based moisturizer while your skin is still moist. For very dry skin, oils may be preferable - they have more staying power than creams or lotions do and are more effective at preventing water from evaporating from your skin. During cold, dry weather, you may need to apply a moisturizer several times a day. - Expose your skin to small amounts of sunlight. A controlled amount of sunlight can improve psoriasis, but too much sun can trigger or worsen outbreaks and increase the risk of skin cancer. First ask your doctor about the best way to use natural sunlight to treat your skin. Log your time in the sun, and protect skin that isn't affected by psoriasis with sunscreen. - Avoid psoriasis triggers, if possible. Find out what triggers, if any, worsen your psoriasis and take steps to prevent or avoid them. Infections, injuries to your skin, stress, smoking and intense sun exposure can all worsen psoriasis. - Avoid drinking alcohol. Alcohol consumption may decrease the effectiveness of some psoriasis treatments. If you have psoriasis, avoid alcohol. If you do drink, keep it moderate."

        "document": "Multiple sclerosis (Treatment): There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatment typically focuses on speeding recovery from attacks, slowing the progression of the disease and managing MS symptoms. Some people have such mild symptoms that no treatment is necessary. Treatments for MS attacks - Corticosteroids, such as oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone, are prescribed to reduce nerve inflammation. Side effects may include insomnia, increased blood pressure, mood swings and fluid retention. - Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis). The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then mixed with a protein solution (albumin) and put back into your body. Plasma exchange may be used if your symptoms are new, severe and haven't responded to steroids. Treatments to modify progression For primary-progressive MS, ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is the only FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy. It slows worsening of disability in people with this type of MS. For relapsing-remitting MS, several disease-modifying therapies are available. Much of the immune response associated with MS occurs in the early stages of the disease. Aggressive treatment with these medications as early as possible can lower the relapse rate and slow the formation of new lesions. Many of the disease-modifying therapies used to treat MS carry significant health risks. Selecting the right therapy for you will depend on careful consideration of many factors, including duration and severity of disease, effectiveness of previous MS treatments, other health issues, cost, and child-bearing status. Treatment options for relapsing-remitting MS include: - Beta interferons. These medications are among the most commonly prescribed medications to treat MS. They are injected under the skin or into muscle and can reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Side effects of beta interferons may include flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions. You'll need blood tests to monitor your liver enzymes because liver damage is a possible side effect of interferon use. People taking interferons may develop neutralizing antibodies that can reduce drug effectiveness. - Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus). This humanized immunoglobulin antibody medication is the only DMT approved by the FDA to treat both the relapse-remitting and primary progressive forms of MS. Clinical trials showed it reduced relapse rate in relapsing disease and slowed worsening of disability in both forms of the disease. Ocrevus is given via an intravenous infusion by a medical professional. Side effects may infusion-related reactions including irritation at the injection site, low blood pressure, fever, and nausea among others. Ocrevus may also increase the risk of some types of cancer, particularly breast cancer. - Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone). This medication may help block your immune system's attack on myelin and must be injected beneath the skin. Side effects may include skin irritation at the injection site. - Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera). This twice-daily oral medication can reduce relapses. Side effects may include flushing, diarrhea, nausea and lowered white blood cell count. - Fingolimod (Gilenya). This once-daily oral medication reduces relapse rate. You'll need to have your heart rate monitored for six hours after the first dose because your heartbeat may be slowed. Other side effects include headache, high blood pressure and blurred vision. - Teriflunomide (Aubagio). This once-daily medication can reduce relapse rate. Teriflunomide can cause liver damage, hair loss and other side effects. It is harmful to a developing fetus and should not be used by women who may become pregnant and are not using appropriate contraception, or their male partner. - Natalizumab (Tysabri). This medication is designed to block the movement of potentially damaging immune cells from your bloodstream to your brain and spinal cord. It may be considered a first line treatment for some people with severe MS or as a second line treatment in others. This medication increases the risk of a viral infection of the brain called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in some people. - Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada). This drug helps reduce relapses of MS by targeting a protein on the surface of immune cells and depleting white blood cells. This effect can limit potential nerve damage caused by the white blood cells, but it also increases the risk of infections and autoimmune disorders. Treatment with alemtuzumab involves five consecutive days of drug infusions followed by another three days of infusions a year later. Infusion reactions are common with alemtuzumab. The drug is only available from registered providers, and people treated with the drug must be registered in a special drug safety monitoring program. - Mitoxantrone. This immunosuppressant drug can be harmful to the heart and is associated with development of blood cancers. As a result, its use in treating MS is extremely limited. Mitoxantrone is usually used only to treat severe, advanced MS. Treatments for MS signs and symptoms - Physical therapy. A physical or occupational therapist can teach you stretching and strengthening exercises and show you how to use devices to make it easier to perform daily tasks. Physical therapy along with the use of a mobility aid when necessary can also help manage leg weakness and other gait problems often associated with MS. - Muscle relaxants. You may experience painful or uncontrollable muscle stiffness or spasms, particularly in your legs. Muscle relaxants such as baclofen (Lioresal) and tizanidine (Zanaflex) may help. - Medications to reduce fatigue. - Other medications. Medications also may be prescribed for depression, pain, sexual dysfunction, and bladder or bowel control problems that are associated with MS."

        "document": "Multiple sclerosis: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body. Eventually, the disease can cause the nerves themselves to deteriorate or become permanently damaged. Signs and symptoms of MS vary widely and depend on the amount of nerve damage and which nerves are affected. Some people with severe MS may lose the ability to walk independently or at all, while others may experience long periods of remission without any new symptoms. There's no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, treatments can help speed recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms. Find out why Mayo Clinic is the best place for your care. Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms may differ greatly from person to person and over the course of the disease depending on the location of affected nerve fibers. They may include: - Numbness or weakness in one or more limbs that typically occurs on one side of your body at a time, or the legs and trunk   - Partial or complete loss of vision, usually in one eye at a time, often with pain during eye movement   - Prolonged double vision   - Tingling or pain in parts of your body   - Electric-shock sensations that occur with certain neck movements, especially bending the neck forward (Lhermitte sign)   - Tremor, lack of coordination or unsteady gait   - Slurred speech   - Fatigue   - Dizziness   - Problems with bowel and bladder function When to see a doctor See a doctor if you experience any of the above symptoms for unknown reasons. Disease course Most people with MS have a relapsing-remitting disease course. They experience periods of new symptoms or relapses that develop over days or weeks and usually improve partially or completely. These relapses are followed by quiet periods of disease remission that can last months or even years. Small increases in body temperature can temporarily worsen signs and symptoms of MS, but these aren't considered disease relapses. About 60 to 70 percent of people with relapsing-remitting MS eventually develop a steady progression of symptoms, with or without periods of remission, known as secondary-progressive MS. The worsening of symptoms usually includes problems with mobility and gait. The rate of disease progression varies greatly among people with secondary-progressive MS. Some people with MS experience a gradual onset and steady progression of signs and symptoms without any relapses. This is known as primary-progressive MS. The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown. It's considered an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. In the case of MS, this immune system malfunction destroys myelin (the fatty substance that coats and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord). Myelin can be compared to the insulation coating on electrical wires. When the protective myelin is damaged and nerve fiber is exposed, the messages that travel along that nerve may be slowed or blocked. The nerve may also become damaged itself. It isn't clear why MS develops in some people and not others. A combination of genetics and environmental factors appears to be responsible. These factors may increase your risk of developing multiple sclerosis: - Age. MS can occur at any age, but most commonly affects people between the ages of 15 and 60.   - Sex. Women are about twice as likely as men are to develop MS.   - Family history. If one of your parents or siblings has had MS, you are at higher risk of developing the disease.   - Certain infections. A variety of viruses have been linked to MS, including Epstein-Barr, the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis.   - Race. White people, particularly those of Northern European descent, are at highest risk of developing MS. People of Asian, African or Native American descent have the lowest risk.   - Climate. MS is far more common in countries with temperate climates, including Canada, the northern United States, New Zealand, southeastern Australia and Europe.   - Certain autoimmune diseases. You have a slightly higher risk of developing MS if you have thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease.   - Smoking. Smokers who experience an initial event of symptoms that may signal MS are more likely than nonsmokers to develop a second event that confirms relapsing-remitting MS. There are no specific tests for MS. Instead, a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis often relies on ruling out other conditions that might produce similar signs and symptoms, known as a differential diagnosis. Your doctor is likely to start with a thorough medical history and examination. Your doctor may then recommend: - Blood tests, to help rule out other diseases with symptoms similar to MS. Tests to check for specific biomarkers associated with MS are currently under development and may also aid in diagnosing the disease. - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap), in which a small sample of fluid is removed from your spinal canal for laboratory analysis. This sample can show abnormalities in antibodies that are associated with MS. Spinal tap can also help rule out infections and other conditions with symptoms similar to MS. - MRI, which can reveal areas of MS (lesions) on your brain and spinal cord. You may receive an intravenous injection of a contrast material to highlight lesions that indicate your disease is in an active phase. - Evoked potential tests, which record the electrical signals produced by your nervous system in response to stimuli. An evoked potential test may use visual stimuli or electrical stimuli, in which you watch a moving visual pattern, or short electrical impulses are applied to nerves in your legs or arms. Electrodes measure how quickly the information travels down your nerve pathways. In most people with relapsing-remitting MS, the diagnosis is fairly straightforward and based on a pattern of symptoms consistent with the disease and confirmed by brain imaging scans, such as MRI. Diagnosing MS can be more difficult in persons with unusual symptoms or progressive disease. In these cases, further testing with spinal fluid analysis, evoked potentials and additional imaging may be needed. There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatment typically focuses on speeding recovery from attacks, slowing the progression of the disease and managing MS symptoms. Some people have such mild symptoms that no treatment is necessary.

Medications also may be prescribed for depression, pain, sexual dysfunction, and bladder or bowel control problems that are associated with MS. To help relieve the signs and symptoms of MS, try to: - Get plenty of rest. - Exercise. If you have mild to moderate MS, regular exercise can help improve your strength, muscle tone, balance and coordination. Swimming or other water exercises are good options if you're bothered by heat. Other types of mild to moderate exercise recommended for people with MS include walking, stretching, low-impact aerobics, stationary bicycling, yoga and tai chi. - Cool down. MS symptoms often worsen when your body temperature rises. Avoiding exposure to heat and using devices such as cooling scarves or vests can be helpful. - Eat a balanced diet. Results of small studies suggest that a diet low in saturated fat but high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as those found in olive and fish oils, may be beneficial. But further research is needed. Studies also suggest that vitamin D may have potential benefit for people with MS. - Relieve stress. Stress may trigger or worsen your signs and symptoms. Yoga, tai chi, massage, meditation or deep breathing may help. Many people with MS use a variety of alternative or complementary treatments or both to help manage their symptoms, such as fatigue and muscle pain. Activities such as exercise, meditation, yoga, massage, eating a healthier diet, acupuncture and relaxation techniques may help boost overall mental and physical well-being, but there are few studies to back up their use in managing symptoms of MS. Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology recommend the use of oral cannabis extract for muscle spasticity and pain, but do not recommend cannabis in any other form for other MS symptoms due to a lack of evidence. The guidelines also do not recommend the use of herbal supplements such as Ginkgo biloba and bee venom or magnetic therapy for MS symptoms."

        "query": "Research assignment Hi, I am a grade 12 student who is doing a research assignment on neurological disorders. Do you believe that there will ever be a bonafide cure for Multiple Sclerosis? If so, what kind of time frame would put on this cure?",
        "document": "Multiple Sclerosis: An unpredictable disease of the central nervous system, multiple sclerosis (MS) can range from relatively benign to somewhat disabling to devastating, as communication between the brain and other parts of the body is disrupted.\u00a0 Many investigators believe MS to be an autoimmune disease -- one in which the body, through its immune system, launches a defensive attack against its own tissues. In the case of MS, it is the nerve-insulating myelin that comes under assault. Such assaults may be linked to an unknown environmental trigger, perhaps a virus. Most people experience their first symptoms of MS between the ages of 20 and 40; the initial symptom of MS is often blurred or double vision, red-green color distortion, or even blindness in one eye.\u00a0 Most MS patients experience muscle weakness in their extremities and difficulty with coordination and balance.\u00a0 These symptoms may be severe enough to impair walking or even standing. In the worst cases, MS can produce partial or complete paralysis.\u00a0 Most people with MS also exhibit paresthesias, transitory abnormal sensory feelings such as numbness, prickling, or \"pins and needles\" sensations.\u00a0 Some may also experience pain.\u00a0 Speech impediments, tremors, and dizziness are other frequent complaints. Occasionally, people with MS have hearing loss. Approximately half of all people with MS experience cognitive impairments such as difficulties with concentration, attention, memory, and poor judgment, but such symptoms are usually mild and are frequently overlooked.\u00a0 Depression is another common feature of MS. Currently there is no cure for MS. Many\u00a0individuals do well with no therapy at all, especially since many medications have serious side effects and some carry significant risks.\u00a0 However, three forms of beta interferon (Avonex, Betaseron, and Rebif) have now been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of relapsing-remitting MS.\u00a0 The FDA has also approved ocrelizumab (brand name Ocrevus) to treat adults with relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive MS. Beta interferon has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations and may slow the progression of physical disability. When attacks do occur, they tend to be shorter and less severe.\u00a0 The FDA also has approved a synthetic form of myelin basic protein, called copolymer I (Copaxone), for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. Copolymer I has few side effects, and studies indicate that the agent can reduce the relapse rate by almost one third. \u00a0Other FDA approved drugs to treat relapsing forms of MS in adults include teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate. \u00a0An immunosuppressant treatment,Novantrone\u00a0(mitoxantrone), is\u00a0approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced or chronic MS. \u00a0The FDA has also approved dalfampridine (Ampyra) to improve walking in individuals with MS. One monoclonal antibody, natalizumab (Tysabri), was shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce the frequency of attacks in people with relapsing forms of MS and was approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004.\u00a0 However, in 2005 the drug\u2019s manufacturer voluntarily suspended marketing of the drug after several reports of significant adverse events.\u00a0 In 2006, the FDA again approved sale of the drug for MS but under strict treatment guidelines involving infusion centers where patients can be monitored by specially trained physicians. \u00a0While steroids do not affect the course of MS over time, they can reduce the duration and severity of attacks in some patients.\u00a0 Spasticity, which can occur either as a sustained stiffness caused by increased muscle tone or as spasms that come and go, is usually treated with muscle relaxants and tranquilizers such as baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam, clonazepam, and dantrolene. Physical therapy and exercise can help preserve remaining function, and patients may find that various aids -- such as foot braces, canes, and walkers -- can help them remain independent and mobile.\u00a0 Avoiding excessive activity and avoiding heat are probably the most important measures patients can take to counter physiological fatigue.\u00a0 If psychological symptoms of fatigue such as depression or apathy are evident, antidepressant medications may help.\u00a0 Other drugs that may reduce fatigue in some, but not all, patients include amantadine (Symmetrel), pemoline (Cylert), and the still-experimental drug aminopyridine. Although improvement of optic symptoms usually occurs even without treatment, a short course of treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) followed by treatment with oral steroids is sometimes used. A physician may diagnose MS in some patients soon after the onset of the illness. In others, however, doctors may not be able to readily identify the cause of the symptoms, leading to years of uncertainty and multiple diagnoses punctuated by baffling symptoms that mysteriously wax and wane.\u00a0 The vast majority of patients are mildly affected, but in the worst cases, MS can render a person unable to write, speak, or walk.\u00a0 MS is a disease with a natural tendency to remit spontaneously, for which there is no universally effective treatment."

        "document": "Prostate Cancer: The prostate gland makes fluid that forms part of semen. The prostate lies just below the bladder in front of the rectum. It surrounds the urethra (the tube that carries urine and semen through the penis and out of the body). Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the United States, after skin cancer. It is the second leading cause of death from cancer in men. Prostate cancer occurs more often in African-American men than in white men. African-American men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer. Almost all prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas (cancers that begin in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids). Prostate cancer often has no early symptoms. Advanced prostate cancer can cause men to urinate more often or have a weaker flow of urine, but these symptoms can also be caused by benign prostate conditions. Prostate cancer usually grows very slowly. Most men with prostate cancer are older than 65 years and do not die from the disease. Finding and treating prostate cancer before symptoms occur may not improve health or help you live longer. Talk to your doctor about your risk of prostate cancer and whether you need screening tests. - Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate. - Signs of prostate cancer include a weak flow of urine or frequent urination. - Tests that examine the prostate and blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose prostate cancer. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate. - Signs of prostate cancer include a weak flow of urine or frequent urination. - Tests that examine the prostate and blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose prostate cancer. - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. - After prostate cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the prostate or to other parts of the body. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for prostate cancer: - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV - After prostate cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the prostate or to other parts of the body. - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. - The following stages are used for prostate cancer: - Stage I - Stage II - Stage III - Stage IV  - There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer. - Seven types of standard treatment are used: - Watchful waiting or active surveillance - Surgery - Radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy - Hormone therapy - Chemotherapy - Biologic therapy - Bisphosphonate therapy - There are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy. - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Cryosurgery - High-intensity-focused ultrasound therapy - Proton beam radiation therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed. - There are different types of treatment for patients with prostate cancer. - Seven types of standard treatment are used: - Watchful waiting or active surveillance - Surgery - Radiation therapy and radiopharmaceutical therapy - Hormone therapy - Chemotherapy - Biologic therapy - Bisphosphonate therapy - There are treatments for bone pain caused by bone metastases or hormone therapy. - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials. - Cryosurgery - High-intensity-focused ultrasound therapy - Proton beam radiation therapy - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. - Follow-up tests may be needed.

        "query": "prostate cancer using seeds aimed at maligmem tumors is this a safe decision",
        "document": "Prostate cancer - treatment: Treatment for your prostate cancer is chosen after a thorough evaluation. Your doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of each treatment.   Sometimes your doctor may recommend 1 treatment for you because of your type of cancer and risk factors. Other times, there may be 2 or more treatments that could be good for you.   Factors you and your doctor must think about include:     - Your age and other medical problems you may have   - Side effects that occur with each type of treatment   - How much the prostate cancer has spread   - Your Gleason score, which tells how likely it is that cancer has already spread   - Your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result      Ask your doctor to explain these things following about your treatment choices:     - Which choices offer the best chance of curing your cancer or controlling its spread?   - How likely is it that you will have different side effects, and how they will affect your life? Radical prostatectomy is a surgery to remove the prostate and some of the surrounding tissue. It is an option when the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland.   Healthy men who will likely live 10 or more years after being diagnosed with prostate cancer often have this procedure.   Be aware that it is not always possible to know for certain, before surgery, if the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland.   Possible problems after surgery include difficulty controlling urine and erection problems. Also, some men need further treatments after this surgery. Radiation therapy works best for treating prostate cancer that has not spread outside of the prostate. It may also be used after surgery if there is a risk that cancer cells are still present. Radiation is sometimes used for pain relief when cancer has spread to the bone.   External beam radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays pointed at the prostate gland:     - Before treatment, the radiation therapist uses a special pen to mark the part of the body that is to be treated.   - Radiation is delivered to the prostate gland using a machine similar to a regular x-ray machine. The treatment itself is usually painless.   - Treatment is done in a radiation oncology center that is usually connected to a hospital.   - Treatment is usually done 5 days a week for 6 to 8 weeks.      Side effects may include:     - Appetite loss   - Diarrhea   - Erection problems   - Fatigue   - Rectal burning or injury   - Skin reactions   - Urinary incontinence, the feeling of needing to urinate urgently, or blood in the urine      There are reports of secondary cancers arising from the radiation as well.   Proton therapy is another kind of radiation therapy used to treat prostate cancer. Proton beams target the tumor precisely, so there is less damage to the surrounding tissue. This therapy is not widely accepted or used. Brachytherapy is often used for small prostate cancers that are found early and are slow-growing. Brachytherapy may be combined with external beam radiation therapy for more advanced cancers.   Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive seeds inside the prostate gland.     - A surgeon inserts small needles through the skin beneath your scrotum to inject the seeds. The seeds are so small that you do not feel them.   - The seeds are left in place permanently.      Side effects may include:     - Pain, swelling, or bruising in the penis or scrotum   - Red-brown urine or semen   - Impotence   - Incontinence   - Urinary retention   - Diarrhea Testosterone is the main male hormone. Prostate tumors need testosterone to grow. Hormonal therapy is treatment that decreases the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer.   Hormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. The treatment can help relieve symptoms and prevent further growth and spread of cancer. But it does not cure the cancer.   The main type of hormone therapy is called a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones (LH-RH) agonist:     - The medicine blocks the testicles from making testosterone. The drugs must be given by injection, usually every 3 to 6 months.   - Possible side effects include nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, anemia, fatigue, thinning bones (osteoporosis), reduced sexual desire, decreased muscle mass, weight gain, and impotence.      The other type of hormone medicine is called an androgen-blocking drug:     - It is often given along with LH-RH drugs to block the effect of testosterone produced by the adrenal glands, which make a small amount of testosterone.   - Possible side effects include erection problems, reduced sexual desire, liver problems, diarrhea, and enlarged breasts.      Much of the body's testosterone is made by the testes. As a result, surgery to remove the testes (called orchiectomy) can also be used as a hormonal treatment. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy (medicine that helps the body's immune system fight the cancer) may be used to treat prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone treatment. Usually a single drug or a combination of drugs is recommended. Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, Urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

        "query": "Rubella My grandson (4 yrs old) has contracted Rubella.  I know for sure he has had at least one of the vaccines.  They are living in Mexico right now.  Should we be worried?",
        "document": "Rubella: Rubella, also called German measles or three-day measles, is a contagious viral infection best known by its distinctive red rash. Rubella is not the same as measles (rubeola), though the two illnesses do share some characteristics, including the red rash. However, rubella is caused by a different virus than measles, and is neither as infectious nor usually as severe as measles. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, usually given to children in the United States twice before they reach school age, is highly effective in preventing rubella. Because of widespread use of the vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has declared rubella eliminated in the United States, but cautions parents to make sure their children are vaccinated to prevent its reemergence. The signs and symptoms of rubella are often so mild they're difficult to notice, especially in children. If signs and symptoms do occur, they generally appear between two and three weeks after exposure to the virus. They typically last about two to three days and may include: - Mild fever of 102 F (38.9 C) or lower   - Headache   - Stuffy or runny nose   - Inflamed, red eyes   - Enlarged, tender lymph nodes at the base of the skull, the back of the neck and behind the ears   - A fine, pink rash that begins on the face and quickly spreads to the trunk and then the arms and legs, before disappearing in the same sequence   - Aching joints, especially in young women When to see a doctor Contact your doctor if you think you or your child may have been exposed to rubella or if you have the signs or symptoms listed above. If you're contemplating getting pregnant, check your vaccination record to make sure you've received your MMR inoculations. If a pregnant woman contracts rubella, especially during her first trimester, the virus can cause death or serious birth defects in her developing fetus. Rubella during pregnancy is the most common cause of congenital deafness. It's best for women to be protected against rubella before pregnancy. If you're pregnant, you'll likely undergo a routine screening for immunity to rubella. But if you've never received the vaccine and think you might have been exposed to rubella, contact your doctor immediately. A blood test might confirm that you're already immune. The cause of rubella is a virus that's passed from person to person. It can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or it can spread by direct contact with an infected person's respiratory secretions, such as mucus. It can also be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her unborn child via the bloodstream. A person with rubella is contagious from 10 days before the onset of the rash until about one or two weeks after the rash disappears. An infected person can spread the illness before the person realizes he or she has it. Rubella is rare in the United States because most children receive a vaccination against the infection at an early age. However, cases of rubella do occur, mostly in unvaccinated foreign-born adults. The disease is still common in many parts of the world. The prevalence of rubella in other countries is something to consider before going abroad, especially if you're pregnant. Rubella is a mild infection. Once you've had the disease, you're usually permanently immune. Some women with rubella experience arthritis in the fingers, wrists and knees, which generally lasts for about one month. In rare cases, rubella can cause an ear infection (otitis media) or inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). However, if you're pregnant when you contract rubella, the consequences for your unborn child may be severe. Up to 90 percent of infants born to mothers who had rubella during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy develop congenital rubella syndrome. This syndrome can cause one or more problems, including: - Growth retardation   - Cataracts   - Deafness   - Congenital heart defects   - Defects in other organs   - Mental retardation The highest risk to the fetus is during the first trimester, but exposure later in pregnancy also is dangerous. The rubella rash can look like many other viral rashes. So doctors usually confirm rubella with the help of laboratory tests. You may have a virus culture or a blood test, which can detect the presence of different types of rubella antibodies in your blood. These antibodies indicate whether you've had a recent or past infection or a rubella vaccine. No treatment will shorten the course of rubella infection, and symptoms are so mild that treatment usually isn't necessary. However, doctors often recommend isolation from others - especially pregnant women - during the infectious period. If you contract rubella while you're pregnant, discuss the risks to your baby with your doctor. If you wish to continue your pregnancy, you may be given antibodies called hyperimmune globulin that can fight off the infection. This can reduce your symptoms, but doesn't eliminate the possibility of your baby developing congenital rubella syndrome. Support of an infant born with congenital rubella syndrome varies depending on the extent of the infant's problems. Children with multiple complications may require early treatment from a team of specialists. In rare instances when a child or adult is infected with rubella, simple self-care measures are required: - Rest in bed as necessary. - Take acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) to relieve discomfort from fever and aches. - Tell friends, family and co-workers - especially pregnant women - about your diagnosis if they may have been exposed to the disease. - Avoid people who have conditions that cause deficient or suppressed immune systems. - Tell your child's school or child care provider that your child has rubella."

        "query": "Is it necessary to go to the dr. when getting a skull fracture?",
        "document": "Skull fracture: A skull fracture is a fracture or break in the cranial (skull) bones. Skull fractures may occur with head injuries. The skull provides good protection for the brain. However, a severe impact or blow can cause the skull to break. It may be accompanied by concussion or other injury to the brain.   The brain can be affected directly by damage to the nervous system tissue and bleeding. The brain can also be affected by bleeding under the skull . This can compress the underlying brain tissue (subdural or epidural hematoma).   A simple fracture is a break in the bone without damage to the skin.   A linear skull fracture is a break in a cranial bone resembling a thin line, without splintering, depression, or distortion of bone.   A depressed skull fracture is a break in a cranial bone (or \"crushed\" portion of skull) with depression of the bone in toward the brain.   A compound fracture involves a break in, or loss of, skin and splintering of the bone. Causes of skull fracture can include:     - Head trauma   - Falls, automobile accidents, physical assault, and sports Symptoms may include:     - Bleeding from wound, ears, nose, or around eyes   - Bruising behind the ears or under the eyes   - Changes in pupils (sizes unequal, not reactive to light)   - Confusion   - Convulsions   - Difficulties with balance   - Drainage of clear or bloody fluid from ears or nose   - Drowsiness   - Headache   - Loss of consciousness   - Nausea and vomiting   - Restlessness, irritability   - Slurred speech   - Stiff neck   - Swelling   - Visual disturbances     In some cases, the only symptom may be a bump on the head. A bump or bruise may take up to 24 hours to develop. Take the following steps if you think someone has a skull fracture:     - Check the airways, breathing, and circulation. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR.   - Avoid moving the person (unless absolutely necessary) until medical help arrives. Have someone to call 911 (or the local emergency number) for medical assistance.   - If the person must be moved, take care to stabilize the head and neck.

Not all head injuries can be prevented. The following simple steps can help keep you and your child safe:      - Always use safety equipment during activities that could cause a head injury. These include seat belts, bicycle or motorcycle helmets, and hard hats.   - Learn and follow bicycle safety recommendations.   - Do not drink and drive. Do not allow yourself to be driven by someone who may have been drinking alcohol or is otherwise impaired.

        "document": "Spina bifida (Complications): Spina bifida may cause minimal symptoms or only minor physical disabilities. If the spina bifida is severe, sometimes it leads to more significant physical disabilities. Severity is affected by: - The size and location of the neural tube defect   - Whether skin covers the affected area   - Which spinal nerves come out of the affected area of the spinal cord This list of possible complications may seem overwhelming, but not all children with spina bifida get all these complications. And these conditions can be treated. - Walking and mobility problems. The nerves that control the leg muscles don't work properly below the area of the spina bifida defect, causing muscle weakness of the legs, sometimes involving paralysis. Whether a child can walk typically depends on where the defect is, its size, and the care received before and after birth.   - Orthopedic complications. Children with myelomeningocele can have a variety of problems in the legs and spine because of weak muscles in the legs and back. The types of problems depend on the level of the defect. Possible problems include a curved spine (scoliosis), abnormal growth or dislocation of the hip, bone and joint deformities, muscle contractures and other orthopedic concerns.   - Bowel and bladder problems. Nerves that supply the bladder and bowels usually don't work properly when children have myelomeningocele. This is because the nerves that supply the bowel and bladder come from the lowest level of the spinal cord.   - Accumulation of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). Babies born with myelomeningocele commonly experience accumulation of fluid in the brain, a condition known as hydrocephalus.   - Shunt malfunction. Shunts can stop working or become infected. Warning signs may vary. Some of the warning signs of a shunt that isn't working include headaches, vomiting, sleepiness, irritability, swelling or redness along the shunt, confusion, changes in the eyes (fixed downward gaze), trouble feeding, or seizures.   - Chiari malformation type II. Chiari malformation (kee-AH-ree mal-for-MAY-shun) type II is a common brain abnormality in children with the myelomeningocele form of spina bifida. The brainstem, or lowest part of the brain above the spinal cord, is elongated and positioned lower than usual. This can cause problems with breathing and swallowing. Rarely, compression on this area of the brain occurs and surgery is needed to relieve the pressure.   - Infection in the tissues surrounding the brain (meningitis). Some babies with myelomeningocele may develop meningitis, an infection in the tissues surrounding the brain. This potentially life-threatening infection may cause brain injury.   - Tethered spinal cord. Tethered spinal cord results when the spinal nerves become bound to the scar where the defect was closed surgically, making the spinal cord less able to grow as the child grows. This progressive tethering can cause loss of muscle function to the legs, bowel or bladder. Surgery can limit the degree of disability.   - Sleep-disordered breathing. Both children and adults with spina bifida, particularly myelomeningocele, may have sleep apnea or other sleep disorders. Assessment for a sleep disorder in those with myelomeningocele helps detect sleep-disordered breathing, such as sleep apnea, which warrants treatment to improve health and quality of life.   - Skin problems. Children with spina bifida may get wounds on their feet, legs, buttocks or back. They can't feel when they get a blister or sore. Sores or blisters can turn into deep wounds or foot infections that are hard to treat. Children with myelomeningocele have a higher risk of wound problems in casts.   - Latex allergy. Children with spina bifida have a higher risk of latex allergy, an allergic reaction to natural rubber or latex products. Latex allergy may cause rash, sneezing, itching, watery eyes and a runny nose. It can also cause anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition in which swelling of the face and airways can make breathing difficult. So it's best to use latex-free gloves and equipment at delivery time and when caring for a child with spina bifida.   -  Other complications. More problems may arise as children with spina bifida get older, such as urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and depression. Children with myelomeningocele may develop learning disabilities, such as problems paying attention, and difficulty learning reading and math."

        "document": "Spina bifida: Spina bifida is a birth defect that occurs when the spine and spinal cord don't form properly. It falls under the broader category of neural tube defects. The neural tube is the embryonic structure that eventually develops into the baby's brain and spinal cord and the tissues that enclose them. Normally, the neural tube forms early in pregnancy, and it closes by the 28th day after conception. In babies with spina bifida, a portion of the neural tube fails to develop or close properly, causing defects in the spinal cord and in the bones of the spine. Spina bifida can range from mild to severe, depending on the type of defect, size, location and complications. When early treatment for spina bifida is necessary, it's done surgically, although such treatment doesn't always completely resolve the problem. Types Spina bifida can occur in different forms: spina bifida occulta, meningocele (muh-NING-go-seel) or myelomeningocele (my-uh-lo-muh-NING-go-seel). The severity of spina bifida depends on the type, size, location and complications. \"Occulta\" means hidden. The mildest form, spina bifida occulta results in a small separation or gap in one or more of the bones of the spine (vertebrae). Many people who have spina bifida occulta don't even know it, unless the condition is discovered during an imaging test done for unrelated reasons. In a form of spina bifida called meningocele, the protective membranes around the spinal cord (meninges) push out through the opening in the vertebrae, forming a sac filled with fluid. But this sac doesn't include the spinal cord, so nerve damage is less likely, though later complications are possible. Also known as open spina bifida, myelomeningocele is the most severe form. The spinal canal is open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back. The membranes and spinal nerves push through this opening at birth, forming a sac on the baby's back, typically exposing tissues and nerves. This makes the baby prone to life-threatening infections. Signs and symptoms of spina bifida vary by type and severity. Symptoms can also differ for each person. - Spina bifida occulta. Because the spinal nerves usually aren't involved, typically there are no signs or symptoms. But visible indications can sometimes be seen on the newborn's skin above the spinal defect, including an abnormal tuft of hair, or a small dimple or birthmark.   - Meningocele. The membranes around the spinal cord push out through an opening in the vertebrae, forming a sac filled with fluid, but this sac doesn't include the spinal cord.   - Myelomeningocele. In this severe form of spina bifida:       - The spinal canal remains open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back.    - Both the membranes and the spinal cord or nerves protrude at birth, forming a sac.    - Tissues and nerves usually are exposed, though sometimes skin covers the sac. When to see a doctor Typically, meningocele and myelomeningocele are diagnosed before or right after birth, when medical care is available. These children should be followed by a specialized team of doctors throughout their lives and families should be educated on the different complications to watch for. Children with spina bifida occulta typically don't have any symptoms or complications, so usually only routine pediatric care is needed. Doctors aren't certain what causes spina bifida. As with many other problems, it appears to result from a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors, such as a family history of neural tube defects and folate deficiency. Spina bifida is more common among whites and Hispanics, and females are affected more often than males. Although doctors and researchers don't know for sure why spina bifida occurs, they have identified some risk factors: - Folate deficiency. Folate (vitamin B-9) is important to the healthy development of a baby. Folate is the natural form of vitamin B-9. The synthetic form, found in supplements and fortified foods, is called folic acid. A folate deficiency increases the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube defects.   - Family history of neural tube defects. Couples who've had one child with a neural tube defect have a slightly higher chance of having another baby with the same defect. That risk increases if two previous children have been affected by the condition. In addition, a woman who was born with a neural tube defect has a greater chance of giving birth to a child with spina bifida. However, most babies with spina bifida are born to parents with no known family history of the condition.   - Some medications. For example, anti-seizure medications, such as valproic acid (Depakene), seem to cause neural tube defects when taken during pregnancy, possibly because they interfere with the body's ability to use folate and folic acid.   - Diabetes. Women with diabetes who don't control their blood sugar well have a higher risk of having a baby with spina bifida.   - Obesity. Pre-pregnancy obesity is associated with an increased risk of neural tube birth defects, including spina bifida.   - Increased body temperature. Some evidence suggests that increased body temperature (hyperthermia) in the early weeks of pregnancy may increase the risk of spina bifida. Elevating your core body temperature, due to fever or the use of saunas or hot tubs, has been associated with a possible slight increased risk of spina bifida. If you have known risk factors for spina bifida, talk with your doctor to determine if you need a larger dose or prescription dose of folic acid, even before a pregnancy begins. If you take medications, tell your doctor. Some medications can be adjusted to diminish the potential risk of spina bifida, if plans are made ahead of time. Spina bifida may cause minimal symptoms or only minor physical disabilities. If the spina bifida is severe, sometimes it leads to more significant physical disabilities. Severity is affected by: - The size and location of the neural tube defect   - Whether skin covers the affected area   - Which spinal nerves come out of the affected area of the spinal cord This list of possible complications may seem overwhelming, but not all children with spina bifida get all these complications. And these conditions can be treated. - Walking and mobility problems. The nerves that control the leg muscles don't work properly below the area of the spina bifida defect, causing muscle weakness of the legs, sometimes involving paralysis. Whether a child can walk typically depends on where the defect is, its size, and the care received before and after birth.   - Orthopedic complications. Children with myelomeningocele can have a variety of problems in the legs and spine because of weak muscles in the legs and back. The types of problems depend on the level of the defect.

More problems may arise as children with spina bifida get older, such as urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and depression. Children with myelomeningocele may develop learning disabilities, such as problems paying attention, and difficulty learning reading and math. If you're pregnant, you'll be offered prenatal screening tests to check for spina bifida and other birth defects. The tests aren't perfect. Some mothers who have positive blood tests have normal babies. Even if the results are negative, there's still a small chance that spina bifida is present. Talk to your doctor about prenatal testing, its risks and how you might handle the results. Blood tests Your doctor will most likely check for spina bifida by first performing these tests: - Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) test. For the MSAFP test, a sample of the mother's blood is drawn and tested for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) - a protein produced by the baby. It's normal for a small amount of AFP to cross the placenta and enter the mother's bloodstream. But abnormally high levels of AFP suggest that the baby has a neural tube defect, such as spina bifida, though some spina bifida cases don't produce high levels of AFP. - Test to confirm high AFP levels. Varying levels of AFP can be caused by other factors - including a miscalculation in fetal age or multiple babies - so your doctor may order a follow-up blood test for confirmation. If the results are still high, you'll need further evaluation, including an ultrasound exam. - Other blood tests. Your doctor may perform the MSAFP test with two or three other blood tests. These tests are commonly done with the MSAFP test, but their objective is to screen for other abnormalities, such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), not neural tube defects. Ultrasound Many obstetricians rely on ultrasonography to screen for spina bifida. If blood tests indicate high AFP levels, your doctor will suggest an ultrasound exam to help determine why. The most common ultrasound exams bounce high-frequency sound waves off tissues in your body to form images on a video monitor. The information these images provide can help establish whether there's more than one baby and can help confirm gestational age, two factors that can affect AFP levels. An advanced ultrasound also can detect signs of spina bifida, such as an open spine or particular features in your baby's brain that indicate spina bifida. Amniocentesis If a blood test shows high levels of AFP in your blood but the ultrasound is normal, your doctor may offer amniocentesis. During amniocentesis, your doctor uses a needle to remove a sample of fluid from the amniotic sac that surrounds the baby. An analysis of the sample indicates the level of AFP present in the amniotic fluid. A small amount of AFP is normally found in amniotic fluid. However, when an open neural tube defect is present, the amniotic fluid contains an elevated amount of AFP because the skin surrounding the baby's spine is gone and AFP leaks into the amniotic sac. Discuss the risks of amniocentesis, including a slight risk of loss of the pregnancy, with your doctor. Spina bifida treatment depends on the severity of the condition. Spina bifida occulta often doesn't require treatment at all, but other types of spina bifida do. Surgery before birth Nerve function in babies with spina bifida can worsen after birth if it's not treated. Prenatal surgery for spina bifida (fetal surgery) takes place before the 26th week of pregnancy. Surgeons expose a pregnant mother's uterus surgically, open the uterus and repair the baby's spinal cord. Research suggests that children with spina bifida who had fetal surgery may have reduced disability and be less likely to need crutches or other walking devices. In addition, fetal surgery may reduce the risk of hydrocephalus. Ask your doctor whether this procedure may be appropriate for you. Discuss the risks, such as possible premature delivery and other complications, and potential benefits for you and your baby. It's important to have a comprehensive evaluation to determine whether fetal surgery is feasible. This specialized surgery should only be done at a health care facility that has experienced fetal surgery experts, a multispecialty team approach and neonatal intensive care. Typically the team includes a fetal surgeon, pediatric neurosurgeon, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, fetal cardiologist and neonatologist. Cesarean birth Many babies with myelomeningocele tend to be in a feet-first (breech) position. If your baby is in this position or if your doctor has detected a large cyst or sac, cesarean birth may be a safer way to deliver your baby. Surgery after birth Meningocele involves surgery to put the meninges back in place and close the opening in the vertebrae. Because the spinal cord develops normally in babies with meningocele, these membranes often can be removed by surgery with little or no damage to nerve pathways. Myelomeningocele also requires surgery. Performing the surgery early can help minimize risk of infection that's associated with the exposed nerves and may also help protect the spinal cord from more trauma. During the procedure, a neurosurgeon places the spinal cord and exposed tissue inside the baby's body and covers them with muscle and skin. Sometimes a shunt to control hydrocephalus in the baby's brain is placed during the operation on the spinal cord. Treatment for complications In babies with myelomeningocele, irreparable nerve damage has likely already occurred and ongoing care from a multispecialty team of surgeons, physicians and therapists is usually needed. Babies with myelomeningocele may need more surgery for a variety of complications. Treatment for complications - such as weak legs, bladder and bowel problems or hydrocephalus - typically begins soon after birth. Depending on the severity of spina bifida and the complications, treatment may include, for example: - Walking and mobility aids. Some babies may start exercises to prepare their legs for walking with braces or crutches when they're older. Some children may need walkers or a wheelchair. Mobility aids, along with regular physical therapy, can help a child become independent. - Bowel and bladder management. Routine bowel and bladder evaluations and management plans help reduce the risk of organ damage and illness. Evaluations include X-rays, kidney scans, ultrasounds, blood tests and bladder function studies. These evaluations will be more frequent in the first few years of life, but less often as children grow. - Bowel management may include oral medications, suppositories, enemas, surgery, or a combination of these approaches. - Bladder management may include medications, using catheters to empty the bladder, surgery, or a combination. - For children, a specialist in pediatric urology with experience in evaluating and performing surgery on children with spina bifida is the best choice. - Surgery for hydrocephalus. Most babies with myelomeningocele will need a ventricular shunt - a surgically placed tube that allows fluid in the brain to drain into the abdomen. This tube might be placed just after birth, during the surgery to close the sac on the lower back or later as fluid accumulates. A less invasive procedure, called endoscopic third ventriculostomy, may be used, but candidates must be carefully chosen and meet certain criteria. The surgeon uses a small video camera to see inside the brain and makes a hole in the bottom of or between the ventricles so cerebrospinal fluid can flow out of the brain. - Treatment and management of other complications. To help with functioning, special equipment such as bath chairs, commode chairs and standing frames may be needed. Whatever the issue - orthopedic complications, tethered spinal cord, GI issues, skin problems, or others - most spina bifida complications can be treated or at least managed to improve quality of life. Ongoing care Children with spina bifida need close follow-up care and observation. Their primary care doctors follow growth, the need for immunizations and general medical issues. They coordinate your child's medical care. Children with spina bifida also often need treatment and ongoing care from: - Physical medicine and rehabilitation - Neurology - Neurosurgery - Urology - Orthopedics - Physical therapy - Occupational therapy - Special education teachers - Social workers - Dietitians Parents and other caregivers are a key part of the team, learning how to help manage their child's condition and how to encourage and support their child emotionally and socially. Keep in mind that children with spina bifida can go on to college, hold jobs and have families. Special accommodations may be necessary along the way, but encourage your child to be as independent as possible."

        "document": "Spina Bifida (Are there associated conditions?): Health issues are different for each person with spina bifida. Open spina bifida (myelomeningocele)\u2014in which the spinal cord is exposed\u2014tends to cause more severe problems. Hydrocephalus Many infants born with spina bifida get extra fluid in and around the brain, a condition called hydrocephalus, or water on the brain. The extra fluid can cause swelling of the head, which may lead to brain injury. Chiari II Malformation The brains of most children with open spina bifida are positioned abnormally. The lower part of the brain rests farther down than normal, partially in the upper spinal canal. The cerebrospinal (pronounced suh-ree-broh-SPAHYN-l) fluid can get blocked and cause hydrocephalus. While most affected children have no other symptoms, a few may have upper body weakness and trouble breathing and swallowing. Tethered Spinal Cord Typically, the bottom of the spinal cord floats freely in the spinal canal, but for many people with spina bifida, the spinal cord is attached to the spinal canal. Thus, the spinal cord stretches as a person grows, and this stretching can cause spinal nerve damage. The person might have back pain, scoliosis (crooked spine, pronounced skoh-lee-OH-sis), weakness in the legs and feet, bladder or bowel control problems, and other issues. Paralysis, Mobility Limitations People with spina bifida high on the back (near the head, for instance) might not be able to move their legs. People with spina bifida low on the back (near the hips, for example) might have some leg mobility and be able to walk unassisted or with crutches, braces, or walkers. Lack of Bladder and Bowel Control People with spina bifida often cannot control their bladder and bowel movements. They also can develop urinary tract infections. Latex Allergy Many people with spina bifida\u2014possibly three-quarters of those with the condition\u2014are allergic to latex, or natural rubber. While researchers still don\u2019t entirely understand why the rate in those with spina bifida is so high, some experts believe such an allergy can be caused by frequent exposure to latex, which is common for people with spina bifida who have shunts and have had many surgeries. Learning Disabilities While at least 80% of children with open spina bifida do not have learning deficiencies, some do have learning problems. Other Conditions Some people with open spina bifida have additional physical and psychological conditions, including digestive, vision, sexual, social, and emotional problems; obesity; and depression. \u00ab Is there a cure?

[1] Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)\u00a0is most often inherited in an\u00a0 autosomal recessive manner; less commonly, rare sub-types may be inherited in an\u00a0 autosomal dominant manner.\u00a0 There may be difficulties diagnosing the condition accurately, and often the mode of inheritance cannot be determined. Therefore, it may be challenging to determine the\u00a0exact recurrence risks for some families. Establishing the type of LGMD in an affected individual can be useful for discussing the\u00a0clinical course of the disease as well as for determining who else in the family may be at risk for the condition. [4] Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person\u2019s medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional. Testing Resources Orphanet lists international laboratories offering diagnostic testing for this condition. Unfortunately, no definitive treatments for LGMD exist. Management depends on each individual and the specific type of LGMD that the individual has. However, the American Academy of Neurology has developed guidelines for treatment of LGMD including: [5] [6] Weight control to avoid obesity Physical therapy and stretching exercises to promote mobility and prevent contractures (fixed tightening of the muscles) Use of mechanical aids such as canes, walkers, orthotics, and wheelchairs as needed to help ambulation and mobility Monitoring and surgical intervention as needed for orthopedic complications, such as foot deformity and scoliosis cardiomyopathy A team approach to treatment is recommended including a neurologist , pulmonologist , cardiologist , orthopedic surgeon, physiatrist ,\u00a0physical/occupational/ speech therapist , nutritionist , orthopedist , mental health counselors, and geneticist / genetic counselor . [5] [6] While not a currently available treatment option, some studies have shown\u00a0 promising results with the use of gene therapy .

        "query": "Subcutaneous retrocalcaneal bursitis Haglund's deformity of the calcaneum.  I have this problem.  Can you please help to overcome this?",
        "document": "Bursitis of the heel: Bursitis of the heel is swelling of the fluid-filled sac (bursa) at the back of the heel bone. A bursa acts as a cushion and lubricant between tendons or muscles sliding over bone. There are bursas around most large joints in the body, including the ankle.   The retrocalcaneal bursa is located in the back of the ankle by the heel. It is where the large Achilles tendon connects the calf muscles to the heel bone.   Repeated or too much use of the ankle can cause this bursa to become irritated and inflamed. It may be caused by too much walking, running, or jumping.   This condition is very often linked to Achilles tendinitis. Sometimes retrocalcaneal bursitis may be mistaken for Achilles tendinitis.   Risks for this condition include:     - Starting a very intense workout schedule   - Suddenly increasing activity level without the right conditioning   - Changes in activity level\u00a0   - History of arthritis that is caused by inflammation Symptoms include:     - Pain in the heel, especially with walking, running, or when the area is touched   - Pain may get worse when rising on the toes (standing on tiptoes)   - Red, warm skin over the back of the heel Your health care provider will take a history to find out if you have symptoms of retrocalcaneal bursitis. An exam will be done to find the location of the pain. The provider will also look for tenderness and redness in the back of the heel.   The pain may be worse when your ankle is bent upward (dorsiflex). Or, the pain may be worse when you rise on your toes.   Most of the time, you will not need imaging studies such as x-ray and MRI at first. You may need these tests later if the first treatments DO NOT lead to improvement. Inflammation may show on a MRI. Your provider may recommend that you do the following:      - Avoid activities that cause pain.   - Put ice on the heel several times a day.   - Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.   - Try using over-the-counter or custom heel wedges in your shoe to help decrease stress on the heel.   - Try ultrasound treatment during physical therapy to reduce inflammation.      Have physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle. The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back.   If these treatments DO NOT work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa. After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can break open (rupture).   If the condition is connected to Achilles tendinitis, you may need to wear a cast on the ankle for several weeks. Very rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the inflamed bursa. This condition most often gets better in several weeks with the proper treatment. Call your provider if you have heel pain or symptoms of retrocalcaneal bursitis that DO NOT improve with rest. Things you can do to prevent the problem include:     - Use proper form when exercising.   - Maintain as good flexibility and strength around the ankle to help prevent this condition.   - Stretch the Achilles tendon to help prevent injury.   - Wear shoes with enough arch support to decrease the amount of stress on the tendon and inflammation in the bursa.

        "document": "What is Macular Degeneration?: Macular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is a leading cause of vision loss in Americans 60 and older. It is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving.     AMD affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt, but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Your gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked.    Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision.    NIH: National Eye Institute"

        "document": "Dizziness: Dizziness is a term used to describe a range of sensations, such as feeling faint, woozy, weak or unsteady. Dizziness that creates the false sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving is called vertigo. Dizziness is one of the more common reasons adults visit their doctors. Frequent dizzy spells or constant dizziness can significantly affect your life. But dizziness rarely signals a life-threatening condition. Treatment of dizziness depends on the cause and your symptoms. It's usually effective, but the problem may recur. People experiencing dizziness may describe it as any of a number of sensations, such as: - A false sense of motion or spinning (vertigo)   - Lightheadedness or feeling faint   - Unsteadiness or a loss of balance   - A feeling of floating, wooziness or heavy-headedness These feelings may be triggered or worsened by walking, standing up or moving your head. Your dizziness may accompanied by nausea or be so sudden or severe that you need to sit or lie down. The episode may last seconds or days and may recur. When to see a doctor Call 911 or seek emergency medical help if you experience dizziness with: - A sudden or severe headache   - Ongoing vomiting   - A sudden change in speech, vision or hearing   - Stumbling or difficulty walking   - Fainting   - Chest pain or an irregular heart rate   - Numbness or weakness   - Shortness of breath   - A high fever   - A very stiff neck   - A head injury   - Seizures Consult with your doctor if you experience recurrent, sudden, severe dizziness or prolonged episodes of dizziness, faintness, lightheadedness or vertigo. Dizziness has many possible causes, including inner ear disturbance, motion sickness and medication effects. Sometimes it's caused by an underlying health condition, such as poor circulation, infection or injury. The way dizziness makes you feel and your triggers provide clues for possible causes. How long the dizziness lasts and any other symptoms you have also help pinpoint the cause. Inner ear problems that cause dizziness (vertigo) Your sense of balance depends on the combined input from the various parts of your sensory system. These include your: - Eyes, which help you determine where your body is in space and how it's moving   - Sensory nerves, which send messages to your brain about body movements and positions   - Inner ear, which houses sensors that help detect gravity and back-and-forth motion Vertigo is the false sense that your surroundings are spinning or moving. With inner ear disorders, your brain receives signals from the inner ear that aren't consistent with what your eyes and sensory nerves are receiving. Vertigo is what results as your brain works to sort out the confusion. - Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This condition causes an intense and brief but false sense that you're spinning or moving. These episodes are triggered by a rapid change in head movement, such as when you turn over in bed, sit up or experience a blow to the head. BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo.   - Infection. A viral infection of the vestibular nerve, called vestibular neuritis, can cause intense, constant vertigo. If you also have sudden hearing loss, you may have labyrinthitis.   - Meniere's disease. This disease involves the excessive buildup of fluid in your inner ear. It's characterized by sudden episodes of vertigo lasting as long as several hours. You may also experience fluctuating hearing loss, ringing in the ear and the feeling of a plugged ear.   - Migraine. People who experience migraines may have episodes of vertigo or other types of dizziness even when they're not having a severe headache. Such vertigo episodes can last minutes to hours and may be associated with headache as well as light and noise sensitivity. Circulation problems that cause dizziness You may feel dizzy, faint or off balance if your heart isn't pumping enough blood to your brain. Causes include: - Drop in blood pressure. A dramatic drop in your systolic blood pressure - the higher number in your blood pressure reading - may result in brief lightheadedness or a feeling of faintness. It can occur after sitting up or standing too quickly. This condition is also called orthostatic hypotension.   - Poor blood circulation. Conditions such as cardiomyopathy, heart attack, heart arrhythmia and transient ischemic attack could cause dizziness. And a decrease in blood volume may cause inadequate blood flow to your brain or inner ear. Other causes of dizziness - Neurological conditions. Some neurological disorders - such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis - can lead to progressive loss of balance.   - Medications. Dizziness can be a side effect of certain medications - such as anti-seizure drugs, antidepressants, sedatives and tranquilizers. In particular, blood pressure lowering medications may cause faintness if they lower your blood pressure too much.   - Anxiety disorders. Certain anxiety disorders may cause lightheadedness or a woozy feeling often referred to as dizziness. These include panic attacks and a fear of leaving home or being in large, open spaces (agoraphobia).   - Low iron levels (anemia). Other signs and symptoms that may occur along with dizziness if you have anemia include fatigue, weakness and pale skin.   - Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). This condition generally occurs in people with diabetes who use insulin. Dizziness (lightheadedness) may be accompanied by sweating and anxiety.   - Overheating and dehydration. If you're active in hot weather, or if you don't drink enough fluids, you may feel dizzy from overheating (hyperthermia) or from dehydration. This is especially true if you take certain heart medications. Factors that may increase your risk of getting dizzy include: - Age. Older adults are more likely to have medical conditions that cause dizziness, especially a sense of imbalance. They're also more likely to take medications that can cause dizziness.   - A past episode of dizziness. If you've experienced dizziness before, you're more likely to get dizzy in the future. If your doctor suspects you're having or may have had a stroke, are older or suffered a blow to the head, he or she may immediately order an MRI or CT scan. Most people visiting their doctor because of dizziness will first be asked about their symptoms and medications and then be given a physical examination. During this exam, your doctor will check how you walk and maintain your balance and how the major nerves of your central nervous system are working. You may also need a hearing test and balance tests, including: - Eye movement testing. Your doctor may watch the path of your eyes when you track a moving object. And you may be given an eye motion test in which cold and warm water or air are placed in your ear canal. - Head movement testing. If your doctor suspects your vertigo is caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, he or she may do a simple head movement test called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to verify the diagnosis. - Posturography. This test tells your doctor which parts of the balance system you rely on the most and which parts may be giving you problems. You stand in your bare feet on a platform and try to keep your balance under various conditions. - Rotary-chair testing. During this test you sit in a computer-controlled chair that moves very slowly in a full circle. At faster speeds, it moves back and forth in a very small arc. In addition, you may be given blood tests to check for infection and other tests to check heart and blood vessel health. Dizziness often gets better without treatment. Within a couple of weeks, the body usually adapts to whatever is causing it. If you seek treatment, your doctor will base it on the cause of your condition and your symptoms. It may include medications and balance exercises. Even if no cause is found or if your dizziness persists, prescription drugs and other treatments may make your symptoms more manageable. Medications - Water pills. If you have Meniere's disease, your doctor may prescribe a water pill (diuretic). This along with a low-salt diet may help reduce how often you have dizziness episodes. - Medications that reduce the dizziness. Antihistamines such as meclizine (Antivert) may offer short-term relief from vertigo. Anticholinergics help reduce dizziness. They include scopolamine skin patches (Transderm Scop). - Anti-nausea medications. Your doctor may prescribe a drug to provide immediate relief of nausea. Some of these can cause drowsiness. - Anti-anxiety medications. Diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax) are in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which may cause addiction. They may also cause drowsiness. - Preventive medicine for migraine. Certain medicines may help prevent attacks of migraine. Therapy - Head position maneuvers. A technique called canalith repositioning (or Epley maneuver) usually helps resolve benign paroxysmal positional vertigo more quickly than simply waiting for your dizziness to go away. It can be done by your doctor, an audiologist or a physical therapist and involves maneuvering the position of your head. It's usually effective after one or two treatments. Before undergoing this procedure, tell your care provider if you have a neck or back condition, a detached retina or blood vessel problems. - Balance therapy. You may learn specific exercises to help make your balance system less sensitive to motion. This physical therapy technique is called vestibular rehabilitation. It is used for people with dizziness from inner ear conditions such as vestibular neuritis. - Psychotherapy. This type of therapy may help people whose dizziness is caused by anxiety disorders. Surgical or other procedures - Injections. Your doctor may inject your inner ear with the antibiotic gentamicin to disable the balance function. The unaffected ear takes over that function. - Removal of the inner ear sense organ. A procedure that's rarely used is called labyrinthectomy. It disables the vestibular labyrinth in the affected ear. The other ear takes over the balance function. This technique may be used if you have serious hearing loss and your dizziness hasn't responded to other treatments. Dizziness usually goes away on its own. If you tend to experience repeated episodes of dizziness, consider these tips: - Be aware of the possibility of losing your balance, which can lead to falling and serious injury. - Avoid moving suddenly and walk with a cane for stability, if needed. - Fall-proof your home by removing tripping hazards such as area rugs and exposed electrical cords. Use nonslip mats on your bath and shower floors. Use good lighting. - Sit or lie down immediately when you feel dizzy. Lie still with your eyes closed in a darkened room if you're experiencing a severe episode of vertigo. - Avoid driving a car or operating heavy machinery if you experience frequent dizziness without warning. - Avoid using caffeine, alcohol, salt and tobacco. Excessive use of these substances can worsen your signs and symptoms. - Drink enough fluids, eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep and avoid stress. - If your dizziness is caused by a medication, talk with your doctor about discontinuing it or lowering the dose. - If your dizziness comes with nausea, try an over-the-counter (nonprescription) antihistamine, such as meclizine (Antivert) or one containing dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). These may cause drowsiness. Nondrowsy antihistamines aren't as effective. - If your dizziness is caused by overheating or dehydration, rest in a cool place and drink water or a sports drink (Gatorade, Powerade, others)."

        "document": "Dehydration: Dehydration occurs when your body does not have as much water and fluids as it should.   Dehydration can be mild, moderate, or severe, based on how much of your body's fluid is lost or not replaced. Severe dehydration is a life-threatening emergency. You can become dehydrated if you lose too much fluid, do not drink enough water or fluids, or both.    Your body may lose a lot of fluid from:     - Sweating too much, for example, from exercising in hot weather   - Fever   - Vomiting or diarrhea   - Urinating too much (uncontrolled diabetes or some medications, like diuretics, can cause you to urinate a lot)      You might not drink enough fluids because:     - You do not feel like eating or drinking because you are sick   - You are nauseated   - You have a sore throat or mouth sores     Older adults and people with certain diseases, such as diabetes, are also at higher risk for dehydration. Signs of mild to moderate dehydration:      - Thirst   - Dry or sticky mouth   - Not urinating much   - Darker yellow urine   - Dry, cool skin   - Headache   - Muscle cramps      Signs of severe dehydration:     - Not urinating, or very dark yellow or amber-colored urine   - Dry, shriveled skin   - Irritability or confusion   - Dizziness or light-headedness   - Rapid heartbeat   - Rapid breathing   - Sunken eyes   - Listlessness   - Shock (not enough blood flow through the body)   - Unconsciousness or delirium Your health care provider will look for these signs of dehydration:     - Low blood pressure   - Blood pressure that drops when you stand up after lying down   - White finger tips that do not return to a pink color after your doctor presses the fingertip   - Skin that is not as elastic as normal. When the provider pinches it into a fold, it may slowly sag back into place. Normally, skin springs back right away.   - Rapid heart rate     Your doctor may do lab tests:     - Blood tests to check kidney function   - Urine tests to see what may be causing dehydration   - Other tests to see what may be causing dehydration (blood sugar test for diabetes) To treat dehydration:     - Try sipping water or sucking on ice cubes.   - Try drinking water or sports drinks that contain electrolytes.   - Do not take salt tablets. They can cause serious complications.   - Ask your provider what you should eat if you have diarrhea.      For more severe dehydration or heat emergency, you may need to stay in a hospital and receive fluid through a vein (IV). The provider will also treat the cause of the dehydration.   Dehydration caused by a stomach virus should get better on its own after a few days. If you notice signs of dehydration and treat it quickly, you should recover completely. Untreated severe dehydration may cause:     - Death   - Permanent brain damage   - Seizures You should call 911 if:      - The person loses consciousness at any time.   - There is any other change in the person's alertness (for example, confusion or seizures).   - The person has a fever over 102\u00b0F (38.8\u00b0C).   - You notice symptoms of heatstroke (such as rapid pulse or rapid breathing).   - The person's condition does not improve or gets worse despite treatment. To prevent dehydration:     - Drink plenty of fluids every day, even when you are well. Drink more when the weather is hot or you are exercising.   - If anyone in your family is ill, pay attention to how much they are able to drink. Pay close attention to children and older adults.   - Anyone with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea should drink plenty of fluids. DO NOT wait for signs of dehydration.   - If you think you or someone in your family may become dehydrated, call your provider. Do this before the person becomes dehydrated. Updated by: Laura J.

        "document": "Dehydration: Dehydration occurs when you use or lose more fluid than you take in, and your body doesn't have enough water and other fluids to carry out its normal functions. If you don't replace lost fluids, you will get dehydrated. Anyone may become dehydrated, but the condition is especially dangerous for young children and older adults. The most common cause of dehydration in young children is severe diarrhea and vomiting. Older adults naturally have a lower volume of water in their bodies, and may have conditions or take medications that increase the risk of dehydration. This means that even minor illnesses, such as infections affecting the lungs or bladder, can result in dehydration in older adults. Dehydration also can occur in any age group if you don't drink enough water during hot weather - especially if you are exercising vigorously. You can usually reverse mild to moderate dehydration by drinking more fluids, but severe dehydration needs immediate medical treatment. Thirst isn't always a reliable early indicator of the body's need for water. Many people, particularly older adults, don't feel thirsty until they're already dehydrated. That's why it's important to increase water intake during hot weather or when you're ill. The signs and symptoms of dehydration also may differ by age. - Dry mouth and tongue   - No tears when crying   - No wet diapers for three hours   - Sunken eyes, cheeks   - Sunken soft spot on top of skull   - Listlessness or irritability - Extreme thirst   - Less frequent urination   - Dark-colored urine   - Fatigue   - Dizziness   - Confusion Call your family doctor if you or a loved one: - Has had diarrhea for 24 hours or more   - Is irritable or disoriented and much sleepier or less active than usual   - Can't keep down fluids   - Has bloody or black stool Sometimes dehydration occurs for simple reasons: You don't drink enough because you're sick or busy, or because you lack access to safe drinking water when you're traveling, hiking or camping. Other dehydration causes include: - Diarrhea, vomiting. Severe, acute diarrhea - that is, diarrhea that comes on suddenly and violently - can cause a tremendous loss of water and electrolytes in a short amount of time. If you have vomiting along with diarrhea, you lose even more fluids and minerals.   - Fever. In general, the higher your fever, the more dehydrated you may become. The problem worsens if you have a fever in addition to diarrhea and vomiting.   - Excessive sweating. You lose water when you sweat. If you do vigorous activity and don't replace fluids as you go along, you can become dehydrated. Hot, humid weather increases the amount you sweat and the amount of fluid you lose.    - Increased urination. This may be due to undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes. Certain medications, such as diuretics and some blood pressure medications, also can lead to dehydration, generally because they cause you to urinate more. Anyone can become dehydrated, but certain people are at greater risk: - Infants and children. The most likely group to experience severe diarrhea and vomiting, infants and children are especially vulnerable to dehydration. Having a higher surface area to volume area, they also lose a higher proportion of their fluids from a high fever or burns. Young children often can't tell you that they're thirsty, nor can they get a drink for themselves.    - Older adults. As you age, your body's fluid reserve becomes smaller, your ability to conserve water is reduced and your thirst sense becomes less acute. These problems are compounded by chronic illnesses such as diabetes and dementia, and by the use of certain medications. Older adults also may have mobility problems that limit their ability to obtain water for themselves.   - People with chronic illnesses. Having uncontrolled or untreated diabetes puts you at high risk of dehydration. Kidney disease also increases your risk, as do medications that increase urination. Even having a cold or sore throat makes you more susceptible to dehydration because you're less likely to feel like eating or drinking when you're sick.   - People who work or exercise outside. When it's hot and humid, your risk of dehydration and heat illness increases. That's because when the air is humid, sweat can't evaporate and cool you as quickly as it normally does, and this can lead to an increased body temperature and the need for more fluids. Dehydration can lead to serious complications, including: - Heat injury. If you don't drink enough fluids when you're exercising vigorously and perspiring heavily, you may end up with a heat injury, ranging in severity from mild heat cramps to heat exhaustion or potentially life-threatening heatstroke.   - Urinary and kidney problems. Prolonged or repeated bouts of dehydration can cause urinary tract infections, kidney stones and even kidney failure.   - Seizures. Electrolytes - such as potassium and sodium - help carry electrical signals from cell to cell. If your electrolytes are out of balance, the normal electrical messages can become mixed up, which can lead to involuntary muscle contractions and sometimes to a loss of consciousness.   - Low blood volume shock (hypovolemic shock). This is one of the most serious, and sometimes life-threatening, complications of dehydration. It occurs when low blood volume causes a drop in blood pressure and a drop in the amount of oxygen in your body. Your doctor can often diagnose dehydration on the basis of physical signs and symptoms. If you're dehydrated, you're also likely to have low blood pressure, especially when moving from a lying to a standing position, a faster than normal heart rate and reduced blood flow to your extremities. To help confirm the diagnosis and pinpoint the degree of dehydration, you may have other tests, such as: - Blood tests. Blood samples may be used to check for a number of factors, such as the levels of your electrolytes - especially sodium and potassium - and how well your kidneys are working. - Urinalysis. Tests done on your urine can help show whether you're dehydrated and to what degree. They also can check for signs of a bladder infection. The only effective treatment for dehydration is to replace lost fluids and lost electrolytes. The best approach to dehydration treatment depends on age, the severity of dehydration and its cause. For infants and children who have become dehydrated from diarrhea, vomiting or fever, use an over-the-counter oral rehydration solution. These solutions contain water and salts in specific proportions to replenish both fluids and electrolytes. Start with about a teaspoon (5 milliliters) every one to five minutes and increase as tolerated. It may be easier to use a syringe for very young children. Older children can be given diluted sports drinks. Use 1 part sports drink to 1 part water. Most adults with mild to moderate dehydration from diarrhea, vomiting or fever can improve their condition by drinking more water or other liquids. Diarrhea may be worsened by full-strength fruit juice and soft drinks. If you work or exercise outdoors during hot or humid weather, cool water is your best bet. Sports drinks containing electrolytes and a carbohydrate solution also may be helpful. Children and adults who are severely dehydrated should be treated by emergency personnel arriving in an ambulance or in a hospital emergency room. Salts and fluids delivered through a vein (intravenously) are absorbed quickly and speed recovery."

        "document": "Migraine (Treatment): There is no specific cure for migraine headaches. The goal is to treat your migraine symptoms right away, and to prevent symptoms by avoiding or changing your triggers.    A key step is learning how to manage your migraines at home. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. Then you and your doctor can plan how to avoid these triggers.   If you have frequent migraines, your doctor may prescribe medicine to reduce the number of attacks. You need to take the medicine every day for it to be effective. Medicines may include:     - Antidepressants   - Blood pressure medicines   - Seizure medicines      Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections may also help reduce migraine attacks if they occur more than 15 days a month.   Some people find relief with minerals and vitamins. Check with your doctor to see if riboflavin or magnesium is right for you.   TREATING AN ATTACK   Other medicines are taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild. Be aware that:      - Taking medicines more than 3 days a week may lead to rebound headaches. These are headaches that keep coming back due to overuse of pain medicine.   - Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver.   - Too much ibuprofen or aspirin can irritate your stomach or kidneys.      If these treatments do not help, ask your doctor about prescription medicines. These include nasal sprays, suppositories, or injections.\u00a0The group of medicines most often used is called triptans.   Some migraine medicines narrow the blood vessels. If you are at risk for having a heart attack or have heart disease, talk with your doctor before using these medicines. Some migraine medicines should not be used by pregnant women. Talk with your doctor about which medicine is right for you if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.   Other medicines treat symptoms of migraine, such as nausea and vomiting. They may be used alone or along with the other drugs that treat the migraine itself.    Feverfew is an herb for migraines. It can be effective for some people. Before using feverfew, make sure your provider approves. Herbal remedies sold in drugstores and health food stores are not regulated. Work with a trained herbalist when selecting herbs."

        "document": "Typhoid fever: Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella typhi bacteria. Typhoid fever is rare in industrialized countries. However, it remains a serious health threat in the developing world, especially for children. Typhoid fever spreads through contaminated food and water or through close contact with someone who's infected. Signs and symptoms usually include high fever, headache, abdominal pain, and either constipation or diarrhea. Most people with typhoid fever feel better within a few days of starting antibiotic treatment, although a small number of them may die of complications. Vaccines against typhoid fever are available, but they're only partially effective. Vaccines usually are reserved for those who may be exposed to the disease or are traveling to areas where typhoid fever is common. Signs and symptoms are likely to develop gradually - often appearing one to three weeks after exposure to the disease. Early illness Once signs and symptoms do appear, you're likely to experience: - Fever that starts low and increases daily, possibly reaching as high as 104.9 F (40.5 C)   - Headache   - Weakness and fatigue   - Muscle aches   - Sweating   - Dry cough   - Loss of appetite and weight loss   - Abdominal pain   - Diarrhea or constipation   - Rash   - Extremely swollen abdomen Later illness If you don't receive treatment, you may: - Become delirious   - Lie motionless and exhausted with your eyes half-closed in what's known as the typhoid state In addition, life-threatening complications often develop at this time. In some people, signs and symptoms may return up to two weeks after the fever has subsided. When to see a doctor See a doctor immediately if you suspect you have typhoid fever. If you become ill while traveling in a foreign country, call the U.S. Consulate for a list of doctors. Better yet, find out in advance about medical care in the areas you'll visit, and carry a list of the names, addresses and phone numbers of recommended doctors. If you develop signs and symptoms after you return home, consider consulting a doctor who focuses on international travel medicine or infectious diseases. A specialist may be able to recognize and treat your illness more quickly than can a doctor who isn't familiar with these areas. Typhoid fever is caused by virulent bacteria called Salmonella typhi (S. typhi). Although they're related, S. typhi and the bacteria responsible for salmonellosis, another serious intestinal infection, aren't the same. Fecal-oral transmission route The bacteria that cause typhoid fever spread through contaminated food or water and occasionally through direct contact with someone who is infected. In developing nations, where typhoid fever is endemic, most cases result from contaminated drinking water and poor sanitation. The majority of people in industrialized countries pick up typhoid bacteria while traveling and spread it to others through the fecal-oral route. This means that S. typhi is passed in the feces and sometimes in the urine of infected people. You can contract the infection if you eat food handled by someone with typhoid fever who hasn't washed carefully after using the toilet. You can also become infected by drinking water contaminated with the bacteria. Typhoid carriers Even after treatment with antibiotics, a small number of people who recover from typhoid fever continue to harbor the bacteria in their intestinal tracts or gallbladders, often for years. These people, called chronic carriers, shed the bacteria in their feces and are capable of infecting others, although they no longer have signs or symptoms of the disease themselves. Typhoid fever remains a serious worldwide threat - especially in the developing world - affecting an estimated 26 million or more people each year. The disease is endemic in India, Southeast Asia, Africa, South America and many other areas. Worldwide, children are at greatest risk of getting the disease, although they generally have milder symptoms than adults do. If you live in a country where typhoid fever is rare, you're at increased risk if you: - Work in or travel to areas where typhoid fever is endemic   - Work as a clinical microbiologist handling Salmonella typhi bacteria   - Have close contact with someone who is infected or has recently been infected with typhoid fever   - Drink water contaminated by sewage that contains S. typhi Intestinal bleeding or holes The most serious complications of typhoid fever - intestinal bleeding or holes (perforations) in the intestine - may develop in the third week of illness. A perforated intestine occurs when your small intestine or large bowel develops a hole, causing intestinal contents to leak into your abdominal cavity and triggering signs and symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and bloodstream infection (sepsis). This life-threatening complication requires immediate medical care. Other, less common complications Other possible complications include: - Inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis)   - Inflammation of the lining of the heart and valves (endocarditis)   - Pneumonia   - Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)   - Kidney or bladder infections   - Infection and inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord (meningitis)   - Psychiatric problems, such as delirium, hallucinations and paranoid psychosis With prompt treatment, nearly all people in industrialized nations recover from typhoid fever. Without treatment, some people may not survive complications of the disease. Medical and travel history Your doctor is likely to suspect typhoid fever based on your symptoms and your medical and travel history. But the diagnosis is usually confirmed by identifying S. typhi in a culture of your blood or other body fluid or tissue. Body fluid or tissue culture For the culture, a small sample of your blood, stool, urine or bone marrow is placed on a special medium that encourages the growth of bacteria. The culture is checked under a microscope for the presence of typhoid bacteria. A bone marrow culture often is the most sensitive test for S. typhi. Although performing a culture test is the mainstay for diagnosis, in some instances other testing may be used to confirm a suspected typhoid fever infection, such as a test to detect antibodies to typhoid bacteria in your blood or a test that checks for typhoid DNA in your blood. Antibiotic therapy is the only effective treatment for typhoid fever. Commonly prescribed antibiotics - Ciprofloxacin (Cipro). In the United States, doctors often prescribe this for nonpregnant adults. - Ceftriaxone (Rocephin). This injectable antibiotic is an alternative for people who may not be candidates for ciprofloxacin, such as children. These drugs can cause side effects, and long-term use can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Problems with antibiotic resistance In the past, the drug of choice was chloramphenicol. Doctors no longer commonly use it, however, because of side effects, a high rate of health deterioration after a period of improvement (relapse) and widespread bacterial resistance. In fact, the existence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a growing problem in the treatment of typhoid fever, especially in the developing world. In recent years, S. typhi also has proved resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin. Other treatments Other treatments include: - Drinking fluids. This helps prevent the dehydration that results from a prolonged fever and diarrhea. If you're severely dehydrated, you may need to receive fluids through a vein (intravenously). - Surgery. If your intestines become perforated, you'll need surgery to repair the hole."

        "document": "Best vitelliform macular dystrophy: Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is a slowly progressive form of macular degeneration. It usually begins in childhood or adolescence, but age of onset and severity of vision loss can vary. Affected people first have normal vision, followed by decreased central visual acuity and distorted vision (metamorphopsia). Peripheral vision is not affected. [1] BVMD is characterized by atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium\u00a0(The retina is the back part of the eye that contains the specialized cells that respond to light, known as \u00a0photoreceptors) and impaired central visual function. [2]\u00a0BVMD is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported. The condition is typically caused by mutations in the BEST1 gene ; in a few cases the cause is unknown. Treatment is symptomatic and involves the use of low vision aids, and direct laser treatment or photodynamic therapy.\u00a0Newer treatment includes anti-VEGF agents ( bevacizumab) and transcorneal electrical retinal stimulation. [1] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cystoid macular degeneration Very frequent Metamorphopsia Very frequent Visual impairment Very frequent Abnormality of color vision Frequent Choroideremia Occasional Visual field defect Occasional Abnormal electroretinogram - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Macular dystrophy - Reduced visual acuity - Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is caused by changes ( mutations ) in the gene . [1] This gene gives the body instructions for making a protein called bestrophin. Bestrophin acts as a channel that controls the movement of chloride ions within the retina. It is thought that mutations in the BEST1 gene affect the shape of the channel and its ability to properly regulate the flow of chloride. However, it is unclear how exactly this relates to the specific features of BVMD. [3] Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, although a few cases with autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported. [1] In autosomal dominant inheritance, having one changed ( mutated ) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause symptoms of the condition. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated gene. Most people with BVMD have an affected parent, but some people have the condition as the result of a new mutation that occurred for the first time. [1] Autosomal recessive inheritance means that a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell to be affected. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers . Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier. Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) may be diagnosed based on the findings on an exam of the fundus (the interior surface of the eye opposite the lens); an electrooculogram (EOG); and the family history . An eye exam may include other tests as well. A fundus exam may show a typical yellow yolk-like macular lesion. The EOG, which reflects the retinal pigmentary epithelium function, is the most diagnostic test for evaluating vitelliform macular dystrophy. In the majority of the cases, a severe decrease occurs in light response, reflected by an Arden (light-peak/dark-trough) ratio of 1.1-1.5. (The normal Arden ratio is 1.8.) Carriers will also have an abnormal EOG result. \u00a0No correlation exists between EOG result and disease stage, visual acuity, or patient age. EOG results are usually symmetric for both eyes. [4] The family history in affected people is often consistent with either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance. [1] Genetic testing may also be used to make a diagnosis of BVMD. A BEST1 mutation is detected in about 96% of affected people who have an affected family member. In people with no family history of BVMD, the mutation detection rate ranges between 50-70%. A mutation in BEST1 gene is more probable when a vitelliform lesion is accompanied by a reduced Arden ratio on EOG testing.\u00a0The exact type of genetic test ordered to confirm a diagnosis may depend on a person's ancestry, family history, and/or whether other eye disorders are also being considered. [1] There is no specific treatment for Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) at this time. [5] [4] Low vision aids help affected people with significant loss of visual acuity. [6] Laser photocoagulation,\u00a0photodynamic therapy, and anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agents such as bevacizumab have shown limited success in treating some of the secondary features of BVMD such as choroidal neovascularization (when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula and retina).

        "document": "vitelliform macular dystrophy: Vitelliform macular dystrophy is a genetic eye disorder that can cause progressive vision loss. This disorder affects the retina, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Specifically, vitelliform macular dystrophy disrupts cells in a small area near the center of the retina called the macula. The macula is responsible for sharp central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces.   Vitelliform macular dystrophy causes a fatty yellow pigment (lipofuscin) to build up in cells underlying the macula. Over time, the abnormal accumulation of this substance can damage cells that are critical for clear central vision. As a result, people with this disorder often lose their central vision, and their eyesight may become blurry or distorted. Vitelliform macular dystrophy typically does not affect side (peripheral) vision or the ability to see at night.   Researchers have described two forms of vitelliform macular dystrophy with similar features. The early-onset form (known as Best disease) usually appears in childhood; the onset of symptoms and the severity of vision loss vary widely. The adult-onset form begins later, usually in mid-adulthood, and tends to cause vision loss that worsens slowly over time. The two forms of vitelliform macular dystrophy each have characteristic changes in the macula that can be detected during an eye examination. Vitelliform macular dystrophy is a rare disorder; its incidence is unknown. Mutations in the BEST1 and PRPH2 genes cause vitelliform macular dystrophy. BEST1 mutations are responsible for Best disease and for some cases of the adult-onset form of vitelliform macular dystrophy. Changes in the PRPH2 gene can also cause the adult-onset form of vitelliform macular dystrophy; however, less than a quarter of all people with this form of the condition have mutations in the BEST1 or PRPH2 gene. In most cases, the cause of the adult-onset form is unknown.   The BEST1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called bestrophin. This protein acts as a channel that controls the movement of charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) into or out of cells in the retina. Mutations in the BEST1 gene probably lead to the production of an abnormally shaped channel that cannot properly regulate the flow of chloride. Researchers have not determined how these malfunctioning channels are related to the buildup of lipofuscin in the macula and progressive vision loss.   The PRPH2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called peripherin 2. This protein is essential for the normal function of light-sensing (photoreceptor) cells in the retina. Mutations in the PRPH2 gene cause vision loss by disrupting structures in these cells that contain light-sensing pigments. It is unclear why PRPH2 mutations affect only central vision in people with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy. Best disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.   The inheritance pattern of adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy is uncertain. Some studies have suggested that this disorder may be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is difficult to be sure, however, because many affected people have no history of the disorder in their family, and only a small number of affected families have been reported.

[2] Management usually includes a comprehensive eye examination once or twice a year to monitor progression of the disease and for complications such as choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ). [4]\u00a0 CNV is sometimes associated with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy because macular degeneration can damage the retinal layers. When this happens, the vascular layer of the eye between the sclera and the retina known as the choroid may produce new blood vessels (neovascularization) which grow up through the damaged layers and leak or bleed into the retina. This can cause vision loss on its own. If CNV does develop, anti-VEGF therapy such as Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab can control and even reverse the CNV. However anti-VEGF therapy does not stop or reverse the vision loss caused by adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy, only the extra vision loss that is due to also developing CNV. [2]\u00a0 Although vision loss is usually slow, when vision is impaired significantly, people with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy may be referred for low vision testing and rehabilitation. Low vision rehabilitation can help maintain and optimize reading ability and improve overall quality of life. [4] [5]"

        "document": "Williams syndrome: Williams syndrome is a rare disorder that can lead to problems with development. It is passed down in families (inherited). Williams syndrome is caused by not having a copy of several genes. Parents may not have any family history of the condition. However, people with Williams syndrome have a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of their children. It often occurs randomly.   Williams syndrome occurs in about 1 in 8,000 births.   One of the 25 missing genes is the gene that produces elastin, a protein that allows blood vessels and other tissues in the body to stretch. It is likely that missing a copy of this gene results in the narrowing of blood vessels, stretchy skin, and flexible joints seen in this condition. Symptoms of Williams syndrome are:     - Delayed speech that may later turn into strong speaking ability and strong learning by hearing   - Developmental delay   - Easily distracted, attention deficit disorder (ADD)   - Feeding problems including colic, reflux, and vomiting   - Inward bend of the small finger   - Learning disorders   - Mild to moderate intellectual disability   - Personality traits including being very friendly, trusting strangers, fearing loud sounds or physical contact, and being interested in music   - Short, compared to the rest of the person's family   - Sunken chest     The face and mouth of someone with Williams syndrome may show:     - A flattened nasal bridge with small upturned nose   - Long ridges in the skin that run from the nose to the upper lip   - Prominent lips with an open mouth   - Skin that covers the inner corner of the eye   - Partially missing teeth, defective tooth enamel, or small, widely spaced teeth Signs include:     - Narrowing of some blood vessels   - Farsightedness   - High blood calcium level that may cause seizures and rigid muscles   - High blood pressure   - Slack joints that may change to stiffness as the person gets older   - Unusual star-like pattern in iris of the eye     Tests for Williams syndrome include:     - Blood pressure check   - Blood test for a missing piece of chromosome 7 (FISH test)   - Echocardiography combined with Doppler ultrasound   - Kidney ultrasound There is no cure for Williams syndrome. Avoid taking extra calcium and vitamin D. Treat high blood calcium, if it occurs. Blood vessel narrowing can be a major health problem. It is treated based on how severe it is.   Physical therapy is helpful to people with joint stiffness. Developmental and speech therapy can also help. For example, having strong verbal skills can help make up for other weaknesses. Other treatments are based on the person's symptoms.   It can help to have treatment coordinated by a geneticist who is experienced with Williams syndrome.

Complications may include:     - Calcium deposits in the kidney and other kidney problems   - Death (in rare cases from anesthesia)   - Heart failure due to narrowed blood vessels   - Pain in the abdomen Many of the symptoms and signs of Williams syndrome may not be obvious at birth. Call your health care provider if your child has features similar to those of Williams syndrome. Seek genetic counseling if you have a family history of Williams syndrome. There is no known way to prevent the genetic problem that causes Williams syndrome. Prenatal testing is available for couples with a family history of Williams syndrome who wish to conceive.

        "document": "COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. Symptoms include breathing difficulty, cough, mucus (sputum) production and wheezing. It's caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most often from cigarette smoke. People with COPD are at increased risk of developing heart disease, lung cancer and a variety of other conditions. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common conditions that contribute to COPD. Chronic bronchitis is inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs. It's characterized by daily cough and mucus (sputum) production. Emphysema is a condition in which the alveoli at the end of the smallest air passages (bronchioles) of the lungs are destroyed as a result of damaging exposure to cigarette smoke and other irritating gases and particulate matter. COPD is treatable. With proper management, most people with COPD can achieve good symptom control and quality of life, as well as reduced risk of other associated conditions. COPD care at Mayo Clinic COPD symptoms often don't appear until significant lung damage has occurred, and they usually worsen over time, particularly if smoking exposure continues. For chronic bronchitis, the main symptom is a daily cough and mucus (sputum) production at least three months a year for two consecutive years. Other signs and symptoms of COPD may include: - Shortness of breath, especially during physical activities   - Wheezing   - Chest tightness   - Having to clear your throat first thing in the morning, due to excess mucus in your lungs   - A chronic cough that may produce mucus (sputum) that may be clear, white, yellow or greenish   - Blueness of the lips or fingernail beds (cyanosis)   - Frequent respiratory infections   - Lack of energy   - Unintended weight loss (in later stages)   - Swelling in ankles, feet or legs People with COPD are also likely to experience episodes called exacerbations, during which their symptoms become worse than usual day-to-day variation and persist for at least several days. The main cause of COPD in developed countries is tobacco smoking. In the developing world, COPD often occurs in people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated homes. Only about 20 to 30 percent of chronic smokers may develop clinically apparent COPD, although many smokers with long smoking histories may develop reduced lung function. Some smokers develop less common lung conditions. They may be misdiagnosed as having COPD until a more thorough evaluation is performed. Air travels down your windpipe (trachea) and into your lungs through two large tubes (bronchi). Inside your lungs, these tubes divide many times - like the branches of a tree - into many smaller tubes (bronchioles) that end in clusters of tiny air sacs (alveoli). The air sacs have very thin walls full of tiny blood vessels (capillaries). The oxygen in the air you inhale passes into these blood vessels and enters your bloodstream. At the same time, carbon dioxide - a gas that is a waste product of metabolism - is exhaled. Your lungs rely on the natural elasticity of the bronchial tubes and air sacs to force air out of your body. COPD causes them to lose their elasticity and overexpand, which leaves some air trapped in your lungs when you exhale. Causes of airway obstruction include: - Emphysema. This lung disease causes destruction of the fragile walls and elastic fibers of the alveoli. Small airways collapse when you exhale, impairing airflow out of your lungs.   - Chronic bronchitis. In this condition, your bronchial tubes become inflamed and narrowed and your lungs produce more mucus, which can further block the narrowed tubes. You develop a chronic cough trying to clear your airways. In the vast majority of cases, the lung damage that leads to COPD is caused by long-term cigarette smoking. But there are likely other factors at play in the development of COPD, such as a genetic susceptibility to the disease, because only about 20 to 30 percent of smokers may develop COPD. Other irritants can cause COPD, including cigar smoke, secondhand smoke, pipe smoke, air pollution and workplace exposure to dust, smoke or fumes. In about 1 percent of people with COPD, the disease results from a genetic disorder that causes low levels of a protein called alpha-1-antitrypsin. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAt) is made in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream to help protect the lungs. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency can affect the liver as well as the lungs. Damage to the lung can occur in infants and children, not only adults with long smoking histories. For adults with COPD related to AAt deficiency, treatment options include those used for people with more-common types of COPD. In addition, some people can be treated by replacing the missing AAt protein, which may prevent further damage to the lungs. Risk factors for COPD include: - Exposure to tobacco smoke. The most significant risk factor for COPD is long-term cigarette smoking. The more years you smoke and the more packs you smoke, the greater your risk. Pipe smokers, cigar smokers and marijuana smokers also may be at risk, as well as people exposed to large amounts of secondhand smoke.   - People with asthma who smoke. The combination of asthma, a chronic inflammatory airway disease, and smoking increases the risk of COPD even more.   - Occupational exposure to dusts and chemicals. Long-term exposure to chemical fumes, vapors and dusts in the workplace can irritate and inflame your lungs.   - Exposure to fumes from burning fuel. In the developing world, people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated homes are at higher risk of developing COPD.   - Age. COPD develops slowly over years, so most people are at least 40 years old when symptoms begin.   - Genetics. The uncommon genetic disorder alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the cause of some cases of COPD. Other genetic factors likely make certain smokers more susceptible to the disease. COPD can cause many complications, including: - Respiratory infections. People with COPD are more likely to catch colds, the flu and pneumonia. Any respiratory infection can make it much more difficult to breathe and could cause further damage to lung tissue. An annual flu vaccination and regular vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia can prevent some infections.   - Heart problems. For reasons that aren't fully understood, COPD can increase your risk of heart disease, including heart attack. Quitting smoking may reduce this risk.   - Lung cancer. People with COPD have a higher risk of developing lung cancer. Quitting smoking may reduce this risk.   - High blood pressure in lung arteries. COPD may cause high blood pressure in the arteries that bring blood to your lungs (pulmonary hypertension).   - Depression. Difficulty breathing can keep you from doing activities that you enjoy. And dealing with serious illness can contribute to development of depression. Talk to your doctor if you feel sad or helpless or think that you may be experiencing depression. COPD is commonly misdiagnosed - former smokers may sometimes be told they have COPD, when in reality they may have simple deconditioning or another less common lung condition. Likewise, many people who have COPD may not be diagnosed until the disease is advanced and interventions are less effective. To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your signs and symptoms, discuss your family and medical history, and discuss any exposure you've had to lung irritants - especially cigarette smoke. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose your condition. Tests may include: - Lung (pulmonary) function tests. Pulmonary function tests measure the amount of air you can inhale and exhale, and if your lungs are delivering enough oxygen to your blood. Spirometry is the most common lung function test. During this test, you'll be asked to blow into a large tube connected to a small machine called a spirometer. This machine measures how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can blow the air out of your lungs. Spirometry can detect COPD even before you have symptoms of the disease. It can also be used to track the progression of disease and to monitor how well treatment is working. Spirometry often includes measurement of the effect of bronchodilator administration. Other lung function tests include measurement of lung volumes, diffusing capacity and pulse oximetry. - Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show emphysema, one of the main causes of COPD. An X-ray can also rule out other lung problems or heart failure. - CT scan. A CT scan of your lungs can help detect emphysema and help determine if you might benefit from surgery for COPD. CT scans can also be used to screen for lung cancer. - Arterial blood gas analysis. This blood test measures how well your lungs are bringing oxygen into your blood and removing carbon dioxide. - Laboratory tests. Laboratory tests aren't used to diagnose COPD, but they may be used to determine the cause of your symptoms or rule out other conditions. For example, laboratory tests may be used to determine if you have the genetic disorder alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAt) deficiency, which may be the cause of some cases of COPD. This test may be done if you have a family history of COPD and develop COPD at a young age, such as under age 45. A diagnosis of COPD is not the end of the world. Most people have mild forms of the disease for which little therapy is needed other than smoking cessation. Even for more advanced stages of disease, effective therapy is available that can control symptoms, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life. Smoking cessation The most essential step in any treatment plan for COPD is to stop all smoking. It's the only way to keep COPD from getting worse - which can eventually reduce your ability to breathe. But quitting smoking isn't easy. And this task may seem particularly daunting if you've tried to quit and have been unsuccessful. Talk to your doctor about nicotine replacement products and medications that might help, as well as how to handle relapses. Your doctor may also recommend a support group for people who want to quit smoking. It's also a good idea to avoid secondhand smoke exposure whenever possible. Medications Doctors use several kinds of medications to treat the symptoms and complications of COPD. You may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed. These medications - which usually come in an inhaler - relax the muscles around your airways. This can help relieve coughing and shortness of breath and make breathing easier. Depending on the severity of your disease, you may need a short-acting bronchodilator before activities, a long-acting bronchodilator that you use every day or both. Short-acting bronchodilators include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others), levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA), and ipratropium (Atrovent). The long-acting bronchodilators include tiotropium (Spiriva), salmeterol (Serevent), formoterol (Foradil, Perforomist), arformoterol (Brovana), indacaterol (Arcapta) and aclidinium (Tudorza). Inhaled corticosteroid medications can reduce airway inflammation and help prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include bruising, oral infections and hoarseness. These medications are useful for people with frequent exacerbations of COPD. Fluticasone (Flovent HFA, Flonase, others) and budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler, Uceris, others) are examples of inhaled steroids. Some medications combine bronchodilators and inhaled steroids. Salmeterol and fluticasone (Advair) and formoterol and budesonide (Symbicort) are examples of combination inhalers. For people who have a moderate or severe acute exacerbation, short courses (for example, five days) of oral corticosteroids prevent further worsening of COPD. However, long-term use of these medications can have serious side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts and an increased risk of infection. A new type of medication approved for people with severe COPD and symptoms of chronic bronchitis is roflumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. This drug decreases airway inflammation and relaxes the airways. Common side effects include diarrhea and weight loss. This very inexpensive medication may help improve breathing and prevent exacerbations. Side effects may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor. Side effects are dose related, and low doses are recommended. Respiratory infections, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia and influenza, can aggravate COPD symptoms. Antibiotics help treat acute exacerbations, but they aren't generally recommended for prevention. However, a recent study shows that the antibiotic azithromycin prevents exacerbations, but it isn't clear whether this is due to its antibiotic effect or its anti-inflammatory properties. Lung therapies Doctors often use these additional therapies for people with moderate or severe COPD: - Oxygen therapy. If there isn't enough oxygen in your blood, you may need supplemental oxygen. There are several devices to deliver oxygen to your lungs, including lightweight, portable units that you can take with you to run errands and get around town. Some people with COPD use oxygen only during activities or while sleeping. Others use oxygen all the time. Oxygen therapy can improve quality of life and is the only COPD therapy proven to extend life. Talk to your doctor about your needs and options. - Pulmonary rehabilitation program. These programs generally combine education, exercise training, nutrition advice and counseling. You'll work with a variety of specialists, who can tailor your rehabilitation program to meet your needs. Pulmonary rehabilitation may shorten hospitalizations, increase your ability to participate in everyday activities and improve your quality of life. Talk to your doctor about referral to a program. Managing exacerbations Even with ongoing treatment, you may experience times when symptoms become worse for days or weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation, and it may lead to lung failure if you don't receive prompt treatment. Exacerbations may be caused by a respiratory infection, air pollution or other triggers of inflammation. Whatever the cause, it's important to seek prompt medical help if you notice a sustained increase in coughing, a change in your mucus or if you have a harder time breathing. When exacerbations occur, you may need additional medications (such as antibiotics, steroids or both), supplemental oxygen or treatment in the hospital. Once symptoms improve, your doctor will talk with you about measures to prevent future exacerbations, such as quitting smoking, taking inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators or other medications, getting your annual flu vaccine, and avoiding air pollution whenever possible. Surgery Surgery is an option for some people with some forms of severe emphysema who aren't helped sufficiently by medications alone. Surgical options include: - Lung volume reduction surgery. In this surgery, your surgeon removes small wedges of damaged lung tissue from the upper lungs. This creates extra space in your chest cavity so that the remaining healthier lung tissue can expand and the diaphragm can work more efficiently. In some people, this surgery can improve quality of life and prolong survival. - Lung transplant. Lung transplantation may be an option for certain people who meet specific criteria. Transplantation can improve your ability to breathe and to be active. However, it's a major operation that has significant risks, such as organ rejection, and it's necessary to take lifelong immune-suppressing medications. - Bullectomy. Large air spaces (bullae) form in the lungs when the walls of the air sacs are destroyed. These bullae can become very large and cause breathing problems. In a bullectomy, doctors remove bullae from the lungs to help improve air flow. If you have COPD, you can take steps to feel better and slow the damage to your lungs: - Control your breathing. Talk to your doctor or respiratory therapist about techniques for breathing more efficiently throughout the day. Also be sure to discuss breathing positions and relaxation techniques that you can use when you're short of breath. - Clear your airways. With COPD, mucus tends to collect in your air passages and can be difficult to clear. Controlled coughing, drinking plenty of water and using a humidifier may help. - Exercise regularly. It may seem difficult to exercise when you have trouble breathing, but regular exercise can improve your overall strength and endurance and strengthen your respiratory muscles. Discuss with your doctor which activities are appropriate for you. - Eat healthy foods. A healthy diet can help you maintain your strength. If you're underweight, your doctor may recommend nutritional supplements. If you're overweight, losing weight can significantly help your breathing, especially during times of exertion. - Avoid smoke and air pollution. In addition to quitting smoking, it's important to avoid places where others smoke. Secondhand smoke may contribute to further lung damage. Other types of air pollution also can irritate your lungs. - See your doctor regularly. Stick to your appointment schedule, even if you're feeling fine. It's important to steadily monitor your lung function. And be sure to get your annual flu vaccine in the fall to help prevent infections that can worsen your COPD. Ask your doctor when you need the pneumococcal vaccine. Let your doctor know if you have worsening symptoms or you notice signs of infection."

        "document": "What is COPD?: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a progressive lung disease in which the airways of the lungs become damaged, making it hard to breathe. You may also have heard COPD called other names, like emphysema or chronic bronchitis. In people who have COPD, the airways that carry air in and out of the lungs are partially blocked, making it difficult to get air in and out. COPD is a major cause of death and illness throughout the world. It kills more than 120,000 Americans each year. That's one death every 4 minutes. How COPD Affects Airways The \"airways\" are the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs through the nose and mouth. The airways of the lungs branch out like an upside-down tree. At the end of each branch are many small, balloon-like air sacs. In healthy people, the airways and air sacs are elastic (stretchy). When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon, and when you breathe out, the balloon deflates and the air goes out. In people with COPD, the airways and air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. Less air gets in and less air goes out of the airways because - The airways and air sacs lose their elasticity like an old rubber band.  - The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed.  - The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed or swollen.  - Cells in the airways make more mucus or sputum than usual, which tends to clog the airways. The airways and air sacs lose their elasticity like an old rubber band. The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed or swollen. Cells in the airways make more mucus or sputum than usual, which tends to clog the airways. COPD Develops Slowly, Has No Cure When COPD is severe, shortness of breath and other symptoms of COPD can get in the way of even the most basic tasks, such as doing light housework, taking a walk, even washing and dressing. COPD develops slowly, and it may be many years before you notice symptoms like feeling short of breath. Most of the time, COPD is diagnosed in middle-aged or older people. There is no cure for COPD. The damage to your airways and lungs cannot be reversed, but there are things you can do to control the disabling effects of the disease. COPD is not contagious. You cannot catch it from someone else."

        "document": "COPD: Espa\u00f1ol \u00a0 Also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic bronchitis; or emphysema. COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. Progressive means the disease gets worse over time. COPD can cause\u00a0coughing\u00a0that produces large amounts of a slimy substance called mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. However, up to 25 percent of people with COPD never smoked. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants\u2014such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dusts\u2014also may contribute to COPD. A rare genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency can also cause the disease. Overview To understand COPD, it helps to understand\u00a0how the lungs work. The air that you breathe goes down your windpipe into tubes in your lungs called bronchial tubes or airways. Within the lungs, your bronchial tubes branch many times into thousands of smaller, thinner tubes called bronchioles. These tubes end in bunches of tiny round air sacs called alveoli. Small blood vessels called capillaries run along the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, a waste product, called carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process, called gas exchange, brings in oxygen for the body to use for vital functions and removes the CO2. The airways and air sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate and the air goes out. In COPD, less air flows in and out of the airways because of one or more of the following: The airways and air sacs lose their elastic quality. The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed. The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged. Normal Lungs and Lungs With COPD In the United States, the term COPD includes two main conditions\u2014emphysema\u00a0and chronic\u00a0bronchitis. In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs are damaged. As a result, the air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. This damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. If this happens, the amount of gas exchange in the lungs is reduced. In chronic bronchitis, the lining of the airways stays constantly irritated and inflamed, and this causes the lining to swell. Lots of thick mucus forms in the airways, making it hard to breathe. Most people who have COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but the severity of each condition varies from person to person. Thus, the general term COPD is more accurate. Outlook COPD is a major cause of disability, and it is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Currently, 16 million people are diagnosed with COPD. Many more people may have the disease and not even know it. COPD develops slowly. Symptoms often worsen over time and can limit your ability to do routine activities. Severe COPD may prevent you from doing even basic activities like walking, cooking, or taking care of yourself. Most of the time, COPD is diagnosed in middle-aged or older adults. The disease is not contagious, meaning it cannot be passed from person to person. COPD has no cure yet, and doctors do not know how to reverse the damage to the lungs. However, treatments and lifestyle changes can help you feel better, stay more active, and slow the progress of the disease."

        "query": "what is epilepsy",
        "document": "Epilepsy: The epilepsies are a spectrum of brain disorders ranging from severe, life-threatening and disabling, to ones that are much more benign. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. The epilepsies have many possible causes and there are several types of seizures. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activity\u2014from illness to brain damage to abnormal brain development\u2014can lead to seizures. Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, changes in important features of brain cells called channels, or some combination of these and other factors. Having a single seizure as the result of a high fever (called febrile seizure) or head injury does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. A measurement of electrical activity in the brain and brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy. Once epilepsy is diagnosed, it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible. For about 70 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. Some drugs are more effective for specific types of seizures. An individual with seizures, particularly those that are not easily controlled, may want to see a neurologist specifically trained to treat epilepsy. In some children, special diets may help to control seizures when medications are either not effective or cause serious side effects. While epilepsy cannot be cured, for some people the seizures can be controlled with medication, diet, devices, and/or surgery. Most seizures do not cause brain damage, but ongoing uncontrolled seizures may cause brain damage. It is not uncommon for people with epilepsy, especially children, to develop behavioral and emotional problems in conjunction with seizures. Issues may also arise as a result of the stigma attached to having epilepsy, which can led to embarrassment and frustration or bullying, teasing, or avoidance in school and other social settings. For many people with epilepsy, the risk of seizures restricts their independence (some states refuse drivers licenses to people with epilepsy) and recreational activities. Epilepsy can be a life-threatening condition. Some people with epilepsy are at special risk for abnormally prolonged seizures or sudden unexplained death in epilepsy."

        "document": "Epilepsy juvenile absence: The following summary is from Orphanet, a European reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs. Orpha Number: 1941 Disease definition Juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) is a genetic epilepsy with onset occurring around puberty. JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures , frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and sporadic myoclonic jerks. Epidemiology The incidence of JAE is still unknown but it accounts for approximately 2-3% of patients with adult epilepsy in general, and about 8-10% of patients with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). No sex predominance has been observed. Clinical description JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures (only one or a few absences daily; 100% of cases), frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS; 80%) and sporadic myoclonic jerks (20%). The seizures onset is typically between 9 and 13 years of age and it manifests as a ''staring spell'' that can be accompanied by atonic postures such as drooping of the head and/or automatisms such as lip smacking. GTCS and myoclonic seizures often occur 1-10 years after the absence seizure onset. Patients with JAE usually develop normally, although uncontrolled absence seizures may have an impact on their ability to learn at school. Etiology The exact etiology of JAE is still elusive. However, genetic mutations for voltage-gated sodium channels ( CACNB4 gene (2q22-q23)), potassium channels ( CLCN2 gene (3q27.1)), and EFHC1 (6p12.3) may be involved in a subset of patients. Moreover, different mutations have been found in genes for GABA receptors (ligand ion channels), specifically in the GABRA1 gene (5q34). Diagnostic methods Diagnosis relies on the clinical features and on electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded awake and during sleep, that displays a generalized 3-4 Hz spike-and-slow-wave complexes. Differential diagnosis Differential diagnosis includes childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, Jeavons syndrome (see these terms). Genetic counseling The transmission is still unknown although an increased risk for first degree related parents to develop JME may exist. Management and treatment The antiepileptic drugs of choice are valproic acid (VPA) and lamotrigine (LTG). In cases where VPA deals with only partial seizure control, add-on of LTG (GTCS) or ethosuximide (absence seizures) can be beneficial. Prognosis Prognosis of JAE is usually favorable with good therapy responsiveness. Generally, seizure freedom can be achieved with antiepileptic medication in 62-84% of all patients with JAE. However, the occurrence of GTCS predicts a worse prognosis. Visit the Orphanet disease page for more resources. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition.

        "document": "Epilepsy - overview: Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which a person has repeated seizures over time. Seizures are episodes of uncontrolled and abnormal firing of brain cells that may cause changes in attention or behavior. Epilepsy occurs when permanent changes in the brain cause it to be too excitable or irritable. As a result, the brain sends out abnormal signals. This leads to repeated, unpredictable seizures. (A single seizure that does not happen again is not epilepsy.)     Epilepsy may be due to a medical condition or injury that affects the brain. Or the cause may be unknown (idiopathic).   Common causes of epilepsy include:     - Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)   - Dementia, such as Alzheimer disease   - Traumatic brain injury   - Infections, including brain abscess, meningitis, encephalitis, and HIV/AIDS   - Brain problems that are present at birth (congenital brain defect)   - Brain injury that occurs during or near birth   - Metabolism disorders present at birth (such as phenylketonuria)   - Brain tumor   - Abnormal blood vessels in the brain   - Other illness that damages or destroys brain tissue     Epileptic seizures usually begin between ages 5 and 20. There is also a higher chance of seizures in adults older than 60. But epileptic seizures can happen at any age. There may be a family history of seizures or epilepsy. Symptoms vary from person to person. Some people may have simple staring spells. Others have violent shaking and loss of alertness. The type of seizure depends on the part of the brain that is affected.   Most of the time, the seizure is similar to the one before it. Some people with epilepsy have a strange sensation before each seizure. Sensations may be tingling, smelling an odor that is not actually there, or emotional changes. This is called an aura.   Your doctor can tell you more about the specific type of seizure you may have:     - Absence (petit mal) seizure (staring spells)   - Generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure (involves the entire body, including aura, rigid muscles, and loss of alertness)   - Partial (focal) seizure (can involve any of the symptoms described above, depending on where in the brain the seizure starts) The doctor will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system.   An EEG (electroencephalogram) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with epilepsy often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures.   To diagnose epilepsy or plan for epilepsy surgery, you may need to:     - Wear an EEG recorder for days or weeks as you go about your everyday life.   - Stay in a special hospital where brain activity can be recorded while video cameras capture what happens to you during the seizure. This is called video EEG.      Tests that may be done include:     - Blood chemistry   - Blood sugar   -  Complete blood count (CBC)   - Kidney function tests   - Liver function tests   - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap)   - Tests for infectious diseases      Head CT or MRI scan is often done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Treatment for epilepsy includes taking medicines, lifestyle changes, and sometimes surgery.   If epilepsy is due to a tumor, abnormal blood vessels, or bleeding in the brain, surgery to treat these disorders may make the seizures stop.   Medicines to prevent seizures, called anticonvulsants (or antiepileptic drugs), may reduce the number of future seizures:     - These drugs are taken by mouth. Which type you are prescribed depends on the type of seizures you have.   - Your dosage may need to be changed from time to time. You may need regular blood tests to check for side effects.   - Always take your medicine on time and as directed. Missing a dose can cause you to have a seizure. DO NOT stop taking or change medicines on your own. Talk to your doctor first.   - Many epilepsy medicines cause birth defects. Women who plan to become pregnant should tell their doctor in advance in order to adjust medicines.      Many epilepsy drugs may affect the health of your bones. Talk to your doctor about whether you need vitamins and other supplements.   Epilepsy that does not get better after 2 or 3 anti-seizure drugs have been tried is called \"medically refractory epilepsy.\" In this case, the doctor may recommend surgery to:     - Remove the abnormal brain cells causing the seizures.   - Place a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS). This device is similar to a heart pacemaker. It can help reduce the number of seizures.        Some children are placed on a special diet to help prevent seizures. The most popular one is the ketogenic diet. A diet low in carbohydrates, such as the Atkins diet, may also be helpful in some adults. Be sure to discuss these options with your doctor before trying them.   Lifestyle or medical changes can increase the risk for a seizure in adults and children with epilepsy. Talk with your doctor about:     - New prescribed drugs, vitamins, or supplements   - Emotional stress   - Illness, especially infection   - Lack of sleep   - Pregnancy   - Skipping doses of epilepsy medicines   - Use of alcohol or other recreational drugs      Other considerations:     - People with epilepsy should wear medical alert jewelry so that prompt treatment can be obtained if a seizure occurs.   - People with poorly controlled epilepsy should not drive. Check your state's law about which people with a history of seizures are allowed to drive.   - DO NOT use machinery or do activities that can cause loss of awareness, such as climbing to high places, biking, and swimming alone. The stress of having epilepsy or being a caretaker of someone with epilepsy can often be helped by joining a support group. In these groups, members share common experiences and problems. Some people with epilepsy may be able to reduce or even stop their anti-seizure medicines after having no seizures for several years. Certain types of childhood epilepsy go away or improve with age, usually in the late teens or 20s.   For many people, epilepsy is a lifelong condition. In these cases, anti-seizure drugs need to be continued. There is a very low risk for sudden death with epilepsy. Complications may include:     - Difficulty learning   - Breathing in food or saliva into the lungs during a seizure, which can cause aspiration pneumonia   - Injury from falls, bumps, self-inflicted bites, driving or operating machinery during a seizure   - Permanent brain damage (stroke or other damage)   - Side effects of medicines Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if:     - This is the first time a person has a seizure   - A seizure occurs in someone who is not wearing a medical ID bracelet (which has instructions explaining what to do)      In the case of someone who has had seizures before, call 911 for any of these emergency situations:     - This is a longer seizure than the person normally has, or an unusual number of seizures for the person   - Repeated seizures over a few minutes   - Repeated seizures in which consciousness or normal behavior is not regained between them (status epilepticus)      Call your doctor if any new symptoms occur:     - Loss of hair   - Nausea or vomiting   - Rash   - Side effects of medicines, such as drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, sedation   - Tremors or abnormal movements, or problems with coordination There is no known way to prevent epilepsy. Proper diet and sleep, and staying away from alcohol and illegal drugs may decrease the likelihood of triggering seizures in people with epilepsy.   Reduce the risk for head injury by wearing a helmet during risky activities. This can lessen the likelihood of a brain injury that leads to seizures and epilepsy. Updated by: Amit M.

        "query": "what is epilepsy",
        "document": "Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness. Anyone can develop epilepsy. Epilepsy affects both males and females of all races, ethnic backgrounds and ages. Seizure symptoms can vary widely. Some people with epilepsy simply stare blankly for a few seconds during a seizure, while others repeatedly twitch their arms or legs. Having a single seizure doesn't mean you have epilepsy. At least two unprovoked seizures are generally required for an epilepsy diagnosis. Treatment with medications or sometimes surgery can control seizures for the majority of people with epilepsy. Some people require lifelong treatment to control seizures, but for others, the seizures eventually go away. Some children with epilepsy may outgrow the condition with age. Epilepsy care at Mayo Clinic Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: - Temporary confusion   - A staring spell   - Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs   - Loss of consciousness or awareness   - Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal (partial) seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: - Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights.   - Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. During a complex partial seizure, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. - Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness.   - Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground.   - Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down.   - Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms.   - Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs.   - Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: - The seizure lasts more than five minutes.   - Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops.   - A second seizure follows immediately.   - You have a high fever.   - You're experiencing heat exhaustion.   - You're pregnant.   - You have diabetes.   - You've injured yourself during the seizure. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice. Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including: -  Genetic influence. Some types of epilepsy, which are categorized by the type of seizure you experience or the part of the brain that is affected, run in families. In these cases, it's likely that there's a genetic influence.  Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes, but for most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures.    - Head trauma. Head trauma as a result of a car accident or other traumatic injury can cause epilepsy.   - Brain conditions. Brain conditions that cause damage to the brain, such as brain tumors or strokes, can cause epilepsy. Stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy in adults older than age 35.   - Infectious diseases. Infectious diseases, such as meningitis, AIDS and viral encephalitis, can cause epilepsy.   - Prenatal injury. Before birth, babies are sensitive to brain damage that could be caused by several factors, such as an infection in the mother, poor nutrition or oxygen deficiencies. This brain damage can result in epilepsy or cerebral palsy.   - Developmental disorders. Epilepsy can sometimes be associated with developmental disorders, such as autism and neurofibromatosis. Certain factors may increase your risk of epilepsy: - Age. The onset of epilepsy is most common in children and older adults, but the condition can occur at any age.   - Family history. If you have a family history of epilepsy, you may be at an increased risk of developing a seizure disorder.   - Head injuries. Head injuries are responsible for some cases of epilepsy. You can reduce your risk by wearing a seat belt while riding in a car and by wearing a helmet while bicycling, skiing, riding a motorcycle or engaging in other activities with a high risk of head injury.   - Stroke and other vascular diseases. Stroke and other blood vessel (vascular) diseases can lead to brain damage that may trigger epilepsy. You can take a number of steps to reduce your risk of these diseases, including limiting your intake of alcohol and avoiding cigarettes, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.   - Dementia. Dementia can increase the risk of epilepsy in older adults.   - Brain infections. Infections such as meningitis, which causes inflammation in your brain or spinal cord, can increase your risk.   - Seizures in childhood. High fevers in childhood can sometimes be associated with seizures. Children who have seizures due to high fevers generally won't develop epilepsy. The risk of epilepsy increases if a child has a long seizure, another nervous system condition or a family history of epilepsy. To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose epilepsy and determine the cause of seizures. Your evaluation may include: - A neurological exam. Your doctor may test your behavior, motor abilities, mental function and other areas to diagnose your condition and determine the type of epilepsy you may have. - Blood tests. Your doctor may take a blood sample to check for signs of infections, genetic conditions or other conditions that may be associated with seizures. Your doctor may also suggest tests to detect brain abnormalities, such as: - Electroencephalogram (EEG). This is the most common test used to diagnose epilepsy. In this test, doctors attach electrodes to your scalp with a paste-like substance. The electrodes record the electrical activity of your brain. If you have epilepsy, it's common to have changes in your normal pattern of brain waves, even when you're not having a seizure. Your doctor may monitor you on video while conducting an EEG while you're awake or asleep, to record any seizures you experience. Recording the seizures may help the doctor determine what kind of seizures you're having or rule out other conditions. Your doctor may give you instructions to do something that will cause seizures, such as getting little sleep prior to the test. - High-density EEG. In a variation of an EEG test, your doctor may recommend high-density EEG, which spaces electrodes more closely than conventional EEG - about a half a centimeter apart. High-density EEG may help your doctor more precisely determine which areas of your brain are affected by seizures. - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can reveal abnormalities in your brain that might be causing your seizures, such as tumors, bleeding and cysts. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of your brain. Your doctor may be able to detect lesions or abnormalities in your brain that could be causing your seizures. - Functional MRI (fMRI). A functional MRI measures the changes in blood flow that occur when specific parts of your brain are working. Doctors may use an fMRI before surgery to identify the exact locations of critical functions, such as speech and movement, so that surgeons can avoid injuring those places while operating. - Positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein to help visualize active areas of the brain and detect abnormalities. - Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). This type of test is used primarily if you've had an MRI and EEG that didn't pinpoint the location in your brain where the seizures are originating. A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein to create a detailed, 3-D map of the blood flow activity in your brain during seizures. Doctors also may conduct a form of a SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM), which may provide even more-detailed results. - Neuropsychological tests. In these tests, doctors assess your thinking, memory and speech skills. The test results help doctors determine which areas of your brain are affected. Along with your test results, your doctor may use a combination of analysis techniques to help pinpoint where in the brain seizures start: - Statistical parametric mapping (SPM). SPM is a method of comparing areas of the brain that have increased metabolism during seizures to normal brains, which can give doctors an idea of where seizures begin. - Curry analysis. Curry analysis is a technique that takes EEG data and projects it onto an MRI of the brain to show doctors where seizures are occurring. - Magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG measures the magnetic fields produced by brain activity to identify potential areas of seizure onset. Accurate diagnosis of your seizure type and where seizures begin gives you the best chance for finding an effective treatment. Doctors generally begin by treating epilepsy with medication. If medications don't treat the condition, doctors may propose surgery or another type of treatment. Medication Most people with epilepsy can become seizure-free by taking one anti-seizure medication, which is also called anti-epileptic medication. Others may be able to decrease the frequency and intensity of their seizures by taking a combination of medications. Many children with epilepsy who aren't experiencing epilepsy symptoms can eventually discontinue medications and live a seizure-free life. Many adults can discontinue medications after two or more years without seizures. Your doctor will advise you about the appropriate time to stop taking medications. Finding the right medication and dosage can be complex. Your doctor will consider your condition, frequency of seizures, your age and other factors when choosing which medication to prescribe. Your doctor will also review any other medications you may be taking, to ensure the anti-epileptic medications won't interact with them. Your doctor likely will first prescribe a single medication at a relatively low dosage and may increase the dosage gradually until your seizures are well-controlled. Anti-seizure medications may have some side effects. Mild side effects include: - Fatigue - Dizziness - Weight gain - Loss of bone density - Skin rashes - Loss of coordination - Speech problems - Memory and thinking problems More-severe but rare side effects include: - Depression - Suicidal thoughts and behaviors - Severe rash - Inflammation of certain organs, such as your liver To achieve the best seizure control possible with medication, follow these steps: - Take medications exactly as prescribed. - Always call your doctor before switching to a generic version of your medication or taking other prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs or herbal remedies. - Never stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor. - Notify your doctor immediately if you notice new or increased feelings of depression, suicidal thoughts, or unusual changes in your mood or behaviors. - Tell your doctor if you have migraines. Doctors may prescribe one of the anti-epileptic medications that can prevent your migraines and treat epilepsy. At least half the people newly diagnosed with epilepsy will become seizure-free with their first medication. If anti-epileptic medications don't provide satisfactory results, your doctor may suggest surgery or other therapies. You'll have regular follow-up appointments with your doctor to evaluate your condition and medications. Surgery When medications fail to provide adequate control over seizures, surgery may be an option. With epilepsy surgery, a surgeon removes the area of your brain that's causing seizures. Doctors usually perform surgery when tests show that: - Your seizures originate in a small, well-defined area of your brain - The area in your brain to be operated on doesn't interfere with vital functions such as speech, language, motor function, vision or hearing Although many people continue to need some medication to help prevent seizures after successful surgery, you may be able to take fewer drugs and reduce your dosages. In a small number of cases, surgery for epilepsy can cause complications such as permanently altering your thinking (cognitive) abilities. Talk to your surgeon about his or her experience, success rates, and complication rates with the procedure you're considering. Therapies Apart from medications and surgery, these potential therapies offer an alternative for treating epilepsy: - Vagus nerve stimulation. In vagus nerve stimulation, doctors implant a device called a vagus nerve stimulator underneath the skin of your chest, similar to a heart pacemaker. Wires from the stimulator are connected to the vagus nerve in your neck. The battery-powered device sends bursts of electrical energy through the vagus nerve and to your brain. It's not clear how this inhibits seizures, but the device can usually reduce seizures by 20 to 40 percent. Most people still need to take anti-epileptic medication, although some people may be able to lower their medication dose. You may experience side effects from vagus nerve stimulation, such as throat pain, hoarse voice, shortness of breath or coughing. - Ketogenic diet. Some children with epilepsy have been able to reduce their seizures by following a strict diet that's high in fats and low in carbohydrates. In this diet, called a ketogenic diet, the body breaks down fats instead of carbohydrates for energy. After a few years, some children may be able to stop the ketogenic diet - under close supervision of their doctors - and remain seizure-free. Consult a doctor if you or your child is considering a ketogenic diet. It's important to make sure that your child doesn't become malnourished when following the diet. Side effects of a ketogenic diet may include dehydration, constipation, slowed growth because of nutritional deficiencies and a buildup of uric acid in the blood, which can cause kidney stones. These side effects are uncommon if the diet is properly and medically supervised. Following a ketogenic diet can be a challenge. Low-glycemic index and modified Atkins diets offer less restrictive alternatives that may still provide some benefit for seizure control. Potential future treatments Researchers are studying many potential new treatments for epilepsy, including: - Deep brain stimulation. In deep brain stimulation, surgeons implant electrodes into a specific part of your brain, typically your thalamus. The electrodes are connected to a generator implanted in your chest or the skull that sends electrical pulses to your brain and may reduce your seizures. - Responsive neurostimulation. Implantable, pacemaker-like devices that help prevent seizures are also under investigation. These responsive stimulation or closed loop devices analyze brain activity patterns to detect seizures before they happen and deliver an electrical charge or drug to stop the seizure. - Continuous stimulation of the seizure onset zone (subthreshold stimulation). Subthreshold stimulation - continuous stimulation to an area of your brain below a level that's physically noticeable - appears to improve seizure outcomes and quality of life for some people with seizures. This treatment approach may work in people who have seizures that start in an area of the brain that can't be removed because it would affect speech and motor functions (eloquent area). Or it might benefit people whose seizure characteristics mean their chances of successful treatment with responsive neurostimulation are low. - Minimally invasive surgery. New minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as MRI-guided laser ablation, show promise at reducing seizures with fewer risks than traditional open brain surgery for epilepsy. - Stereotactic laser ablation or radiosurgery. For some types of epilepsy, stereotactic laser ablation or stereotactic radiosurgery may provide effective treatment for people in which an open procedure may be too risky. In these procedures, doctors direct radiation at the specific area in the brain causing seizures, to destroy that tissue in an effort to better control the seizures. - External nerve stimulation device. Similar to vagus nerve stimulation, this device would stimulate specific nerves to reduce frequency of seizures. But unlike vagus nerve stimulation, this device would be worn externally so that no surgery to implant the device is needed. Understanding your condition can help you take better control of it: - Take your medication correctly. Don't adjust your dosage before talking to your doctor. If you feel your medication should be changed, discuss it with your doctor. - Get enough sleep. Lack of sleep can trigger seizures. Be sure to get adequate rest every night. - Wear a medical alert bracelet. This will help emergency personnel know how to treat you correctly. - Exercise. Exercising may help keep you physically healthy and reduce depression. Make sure to drink enough water, and rest if you get tired during exercise. In addition, make healthy life choices, such as managing stress, limiting alcoholic beverages and avoiding cigarettes."

        "document": "Epilepsy occipital calcifications: The following summary is from Orphanet, a European reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs. Orpha Number: 1459 Disease definition Celiac disease, epilepsy and cerebral calcification syndrome (CEC) is a rare disorder characterized by the combination of auto-immune intestinal disease, epileptic seizures and cerebral calcifications. Epidemiology CEC was first described in 1992 and fewer than 200 cases have been reported so far. Clinical description Celiac disease (CD, see this term) and epilepsy manifest at a variable age, and CD is frequently diagnosed in late childhood, when specific investigations are performed secondary to observation of epileptic seizures and cerebral calcifications (CC). CD can present in a typical form characterized by onset in the first 2 years of life, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, short stature , anorexia, and, in some cases, irritability and vomiting. CD may also present in silent or latent forms, which are characterized - in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms - by dermatitis herpetiformis, dental enamel defects or autoimmune thyroiditis. In CEC patients, CD usually evolves into latent, silent or paucisymptomatic forms. Epilepsy onset is between infancy and adulthood; most cases occur in early childhood. Most patients present with occipital epileptic seizures, the course being highly variable, with benign, drug-resistant, or epileptic encephalopathy forms. In the latter, severe mental deterioration and/or learning disorders have been reported while a mild mental deterioration is observed in only one third of all CEC cases. CCs are seen in subcortical parieto-occipital regions. CC size does not change significantly over time, but in several cases, new CCs appeared in other regions. Patients with CCs and CD without epilepsy are considered as having an incomplete form of CEC. Some patients with epilepsy and CC without CD are considered to have a CEC with latent CD. Etiology Etiology of CEC is unclear. It is not known if epilepsy and/or CC are a consequence of CD. CD is an immune auto-inflammatory reaction occurring in predisposed gluten-intolerant individuals. It originates from the jejunal mucosa and spreads to the lamina propria, leading to the observed histopathological features (crypt hyperplasia, jejunal villous atrophy and inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria). CD may induce autoimmune responses outside the gastrointestinal tract. Circulating activated T cells may cross the blood-brain barrier and be toxic to myelin or myelin-producing cells. As for isolated CD, CEC is associated with the HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genes . Diagnostic methods Diagnosis relies on anamnestic investigation and EEG to characterize epileptic seizures. Computed tomography (CT) imaging reveals CC. Laboratory findings (antiendomisium antibodies , antigliadin antibodies, anti- tissue -transglutaminase type 2 antibodies, HLA phenotype ), and histopathological analysis of small bowel biopsy (jejunal mucosa villous atrophy) enable identification of silent or latent CD in a patient with epileptic seizures and CC. Differential diagnosis Differential diagnosis of CEC includes Sturge-Weber syndrome (see this term) without nevus flammeus and other conditions such as congenital folate malabsorption or adverse effects of methotrexate, antifolate agents and radiotherapy of leukemic children. Management and treatment CD requires life-long observance of a gluten-free diet (GFD), leading to clinical and histopathological resolution of symptoms. A study has revealed that early CD diagnosis and treatment by GFD could prevent or reverse the epileptic disorder. Prognosis Early diagnosis and good compliance of GFD greatly improve outcome. On the contrary, if treatment is delayed, epilepsy may be more severe and epileptic encephalopathy may develop. Visit the Orphanet disease page for more resources. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

        "document": "Epilepsy - children: Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which a person has repeated seizures over time.    A seizure is a sudden change in the electrical and chemical activity in the brain. A single seizure that does not happen again is NOT epilepsy. Epilepsy may be due to a medical condition or injury that affects the brain. Or the cause may be unknown.   Common causes of epilepsy include:     - Traumatic brain injury   - Damage or scarring after infections of the brain   - Birth defects that involve the brain   - Brain injury that occurs during or near birth   - Metabolic disorders present at birth (such as phenylketonuria)   - Benign brain tumor, often very small   - Abnormal blood vessels in the brain   - Stroke   - Other illnesses that damage or destroy brain tissue     Epileptic seizures usually start between ages 5 and 20. But they can happen at any age. There may be a family history of seizures or epilepsy.   A febrile seizure is a convulsion in a child triggered by a fever. Most of the time, a febrile seizure is not a sign that the child has epilepsy. Symptoms vary from child to child. Some children may simply stare. Others may shake violently and lose alertness. The movements or symptoms of a seizure may depend on the part of the brain that is affected.   Your child's health care provider can tell you more about the specific type of seizure your child may\u00a0have:     - Absence (petit mal) seizure: Staring spells   - Generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure: Involves the entire body, including aura, rigid muscles, and loss of alertness   - Partial (focal) seizure: Can involve any of the symptoms described above, depending on where in the brain the seizure starts     Most of the time, the seizure is similar to the one before it. Some children have a strange sensation before a seizure. Sensations may be tingling, smelling an odor that is not actually there, feeling fear or anxiety for no reason or having a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (feeling that something has happened before). This is called an aura. The provider will:     - Ask about your child's medical and family history in detail   - Ask about the seizure episode   - Do a physical exam of your child, including a detailed look at the brain and nervous system     The provider will order an EEG (electroencephalogram) to check the electrical activity in the brain. This test often shows any abnormal electrical activity in the brain. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures.   To diagnose epilepsy or plan for epilepsy surgery, your child may need to:     - Wear an EEG recorder for few days during day-to-day activities   - Stay in the hospital where brain activity can be watched on video cameras (video EEG)     The provider also may order other tests, including:     - Blood chemistry   - Blood sugar   - Complete blood count (CBC)   - Kidney function tests   - Liver function tests   - Lumbar puncture (spinal tap)   - Tests for infectious diseases     Head CT or MRI scan are often done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Much less often, PET scan of the brain is needed to help plan surgery. Treatment for epilepsy includes:     - Medicines   - Lifestyle changes   - Surgery     If your child's epilepsy is due to a tumor, abnormal blood vessels, or bleeding in the brain, surgery may be needed.   Medicines to prevent seizures are called anticonvulsants or antiepileptic drugs. These may reduce the number of future seizures.     - These medicines are taken by mouth. The type of medicine prescribed depends on the type of seizure your child has.   - The dosage may need to be changed from time to time. The provider may order regular blood tests to check for side effects.   - Always make sure your child takes the medicine on time and as directed. Missing a dose can cause your child to have a seizure. Do NOT stop or change medicines on your own. Talk to the provider first.     Many epilepsy drugs may affect your child's bone health. Talk to your child's provider about whether your child needs vitamins and other supplements.   Epilepsy that is not well controlled after trying a number of antiseizure drugs is called \"medically refractory epilepsy.\" In this case, the doctor may recommend surgery to:     - Remove the abnormal brain cells causing the seizures.   - Place a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS). This device is similar to a heart pacemaker. It can help reduce the number of seizures.     Some children are placed on a special diet to help prevent seizures. The most popular one is the ketogenic diet. A diet low in carbohydrates, such as the Atkins diet, also may be helpful. Be sure to discuss these options with your child's provider before trying them.   Epilepsy is often a lifelong or chronic illness. Important management issues include:     - Taking medicines   - Staying safe, such as never swimming alone, fall-proofing your home and so on\u00a0    - Managing stress and sleep   - Avoiding alcohol and drug abuse   - Keeping up in school   - Managing other illnesses     Managing these lifestyle or medical issues at home can be a challenge. The stress of being a caretaker of a child with epilepsy can often be helped by joining a support group. In these groups, members share common experiences and problems. Most children with epilepsy live a normal life. Certain types of childhood epilepsy go away or improve with age, usually in the late teens or 20s. If your child does not have seizures for a few years, the provider may stop medicines.   For many children, epilepsy is a lifelong condition. In these cases, the medicines need to be continued.   Children who have developmental disorders that also cause epilepsy may face challenges throughout their life.   Knowing more about the condition will help you take better care of your child's epilepsy. Complications may include:     - Difficulty learning   - Breathing in food or saliva into the lungs during a seizure, which can cause aspiration pneumonia   - Irregular heartbeat   - Injury from falls, bumps, or self-caused bites during a seizure   - Permanent brain damage (stroke or other damage)   - Side effects of medicines Call your local emergency number (such as 911) if:     - This is the first time your child has a seizure   - A seizure occurs in a child who is not wearing a medical ID bracelet (which has instructions explaining what to do)     If your child has had seizures before, call 911 for any of these emergency situations:     - The seizure is longer than the child normally has or the child has an unusual number of seizures   - The child has repeated seizures over a few minutes   - The child has repeated seizures in which consciousness or normal behavior is not regained between them (status epilepticus)   - The child gets injured during the seizure   - The child has difficulty breathing     Call the provider if your child has new symptoms:     - Nausea or vomiting   - Rash   - Side effects of medicines, such as drowsiness, restlessness, or confusion   - Tremors or abnormal movements, or problems with coordination     Contact the provider even if your child is normal after the seizure has stopped. There is no known way to prevent epilepsy. Proper diet and sleep may decrease the chances of seizures in children with epilepsy.   Reduce the risk of head injury during risky activities. This can decrease the likelihood of a brain injury that leads to seizures and epilepsy. Updated by: Neil K.

        "document": "Congenital heart defects in children (Risk factors): Most congenital heart defects result from problems early in your child's heart development, the cause of which is unknown. However, certain environmental and genetic risk factors may play a role. They include: - Rubella (German measles). Having rubella during pregnancy can cause problems in your baby's heart development. Your doctor can test you for immunity to this viral disease before pregnancy and vaccinate you against it if you aren't immune.   - Diabetes. You can reduce the risk of congenital heart defects by carefully controlling your diabetes before attempting to conceive and during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes generally doesn't increase your baby's risk of developing a heart defect.   -   Medications. Certain medications taken during pregnancy may cause birth defects, including congenital heart defects. Give your doctor a complete list of medications you take before attempting to become pregnant.  Medications known to increase the risk of congenital heart defects include thalidomide (Thalomid), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, statins, the acne medication isotretinoin (Absorica, Amnesteem, Claravis) and lithium.    - Drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Avoid alcohol during pregnancy because it increases the risk of congenital heart defects.   - Smoking. Smoking during pregnancy increases the likelihood of a congenital heart defect in the baby.   -   Heredity. Congenital heart defects sometimes run in families and may be associated with a genetic syndrome. Many children with Down syndrome - which is caused by an extra 21st chromosome (trisomy 21) - have heart defects. A missing piece (deletion) of genetic material on chromosome 22 also causes heart defects.  Genetic testing can detect such disorders during fetal development. If you already have a child with a congenital heart defect, a genetic counselor can estimate the odds that your next child will have one."

The signs and symptoms are usually more severe in males than in females, although the features of this disorder range from very mild to severe in affected women.   Males with Coffin-Lowry syndrome typically have severe to profound intellectual disability and delayed development. Affected women may be cognitively normal, or they may have intellectual disability ranging from mild to profound. Beginning in childhood or adolescence, some people with this condition experience brief episodes of collapse when excited or startled by a loud noise. These attacks are called stimulus-induced drop episodes (SIDEs).   Most affected males and some affected females have distinctive facial features including a prominent forehead, widely spaced and downward-slanting eyes, a short nose with a wide tip, and a wide mouth with full lips. These features become more pronounced with age. Soft hands with short, tapered fingers are also characteristic of Coffin-Lowry syndrome. Additional features of this condition include short stature, an unusually small head (microcephaly), progressive abnormal curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis), and other skeletal abnormalities. The incidence of this condition is uncertain, but researchers estimate that the disorder affects 1 in 40,000 to 50,000 people. Mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene cause Coffin-Lowry syndrome.

        "document": "What is Coffin Lowry Syndrome?: Coffin-Lowry syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniofacial (head and facial) and skeletal abnormalities, delayed intellectual development, short stature, and hypotonia. Characteristic facial features may include an underdeveloped upper jaw bone (maxillary hypoplasia), a broad nose, protruding nostrils (nares), an abnormally prominent brow, down-slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), large low-set ears, and unusually thick eyebrows. Skeletal abnormalities may include abnormal front-to-back and side-to-side curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis), unusual prominence of the breastbone (pigeon chest, or pectus carinatum), dental abnormalities, and short, hyperextensible, tapered fingers. Other features may include feeding and respiratory problems, developmental delay, hearing impairment, awkward gait, stimulus-induced drop episodes, and heart and kidney involvement. The disorder affects males and females in equal numbers, but symptoms are usually more severe in males. The disorder is caused by a defective gene, RSK2, which is found in 1996 on the X chromosome (Xp22.2-p22.1). Thus, the syndrome is typically more severe in males because males have only one X chromosome, while females have two. It is unclear how changes (mutations) in the DNA structure of the gene lead to the clinical findings."

        "document": "Achondroplasia: Achondroplasia is a disorder of bone growth that causes the most common type of dwarfism. Achondroplasia is one of a group of disorders called chondrodystrophies, or osteochondrodysplasias.   Achondroplasia may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, which means that if a child gets the defective gene from 1 parent, the child will have the disorder. If 1 parent has achondroplasia, the infant has a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder. If both parents have the condition, the infant's chances of being affected increase to 75%.   However, most cases appear as spontaneous mutations. This means that 2 parents without achondroplasia may give birth to a baby with the condition. The typical appearance of achondroplastic dwarfism can be seen at birth. Symptoms may include:      - Abnormal hand appearance with persistent space between the long and ring fingers   - Bowed legs   - Decreased muscle tone   - Disproportionately large head-to-body size difference   - Prominent forehead (frontal bossing)   - Shortened arms and legs (especially the upper arm and thigh)   - Short stature (significantly below the average height for a person of the same age and sex)   - Narrowing of the spinal column spinal stenosis   - Spine curvatures called kyphosis and lordosis During pregnancy, a prenatal ultrasound may show excessive amniotic fluid surrounding the unborn infant.   Examination of the infant after birth shows increased front-to-back head size. There may be signs of hydrocephalus (\"water on the brain\").   X-rays of the long bones can reveal achondroplasia in the newborn. There is no specific treatment for achondroplasia. Related abnormalities, including spinal stenosis and spinal cord compression, should be treated when they cause problems. People with achondroplasia seldom reach 5 feet (1.5 meters) in height. Intelligence is in the normal range. Infants who receive the abnormal gene from both parents do not often live beyond a few months. Health problems that may develop include:     - Breathing problems from a small upper airway and from pressure on the area of the brain that controls breathing   - Lung problems from a small ribcage If there is a family history of achondroplasia and you plan to have children, you may find it helpful to speak to your health care provider.

        "document": "Rheumatoid arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect more than just your joints. In some people, the condition also can damage a wide variety of body systems, including the skin, eyes, lungs, heart and blood vessels. An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body's tissues. Unlike the wear-and-tear damage of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of your joints, causing a painful swelling that can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity. The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis is what can damage other parts of the body as well. While new types of medications have improved treatment options dramatically, severe rheumatoid arthritis can still cause physical disabilities. Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: - Tender, warm, swollen joints   - Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity   - Fatigue, fever and weight loss Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first - particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. About 40 percent of the people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many nonjoint structures, including: - Skin   - Eyes   - Lungs   - Heart   - Kidneys   - Salivary glands   - Nerve tissue   - Bone marrow   - Blood vessels Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission - when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent discomfort and swelling in your joints. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system attacks the synovium - the lining of the membranes that surround your joints. The resulting inflammation thickens the synovium, which can eventually destroy the cartilage and bone within the joint. The tendons and ligaments that hold the joint together weaken and stretch. Gradually, the joint loses its shape and alignment. Doctors don't know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely. While your genes don't actually cause rheumatoid arthritis, they can make you more susceptible to environmental factors - such as infection with certain viruses and bacteria - that may trigger the disease. Factors that may increase your risk of rheumatoid arthritis include: - Your sex. Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis.   - Age. Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins between the ages of 40 and 60.   - Family history. If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease.   - Smoking. Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity.   - Environmental exposures. Although uncertain and poorly understood, some exposures such as asbestos or silica may increase the risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis. Emergency workers exposed to dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center are at higher risk of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.   - Obesity. People who are overweight or obese appear to be at somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, especially in women diagnosed with the disease when they were 55 or younger. Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages because the early signs and symptoms mimic those of many other diseases. There is no one blood test or physical finding to confirm the diagnosis. During the physical exam, your doctor will check your joints for swelling, redness and warmth. He or she may also check your reflexes and muscle strength. Blood tests People with rheumatoid arthritis often have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, or sed rate) or C-reactive protein (CRP), which may indicate the presence of an inflammatory process in the body. Other common blood tests look for rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies. Imaging tests Your doctor may recommend X-rays to help track the progression of rheumatoid arthritis in your joints over time. MRI and ultrasound tests can help your doctor judge the severity of the disease in your body. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis. But recent discoveries indicate that remission of symptoms is more likely when treatment begins early with strong medications known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Medications The types of medications recommended by your doctor will depend on the severity of your symptoms and how long you've had rheumatoid arthritis. - NSAIDs. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Stronger NSAIDs are available by prescription. Side effects may include ringing in your ears, stomach irritation, heart problems, and liver and kidney damage. - Steroids. Corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, reduce inflammation and pain and slow joint damage. Side effects may include thinning of bones, weight gain and diabetes. Doctors often prescribe a corticosteroid to relieve acute symptoms, with the goal of gradually tapering off the medication. - Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These drugs can slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and save the joints and other tissues from permanent damage. Common DMARDs include methotrexate (Trexall, Otrexup, Rasuvo), leflunomide (Arava), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine). Side effects vary but may include liver damage, bone marrow suppression and severe lung infections. - Biologic agents. Also known as biologic response modifiers, this newer class of DMARDs includes abatacept (Orencia), adalimumab (Humira), anakinra (Kineret), certolizumab (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), golimumab (Simponi), infliximab (Remicade), rituximab (Rituxan), tocilizumab (Actemra) and tofacitinib (Xeljanz). These drugs can target parts of the immune system that trigger inflammation that causes joint and tissue damage. These types of drugs also increase the risk of infections. Biologic DMARDs are usually most effective when paired with a nonbiologic DMARD, such as methotrexate. Therapy Your doctor may send you to a physical or occupational therapist who can teach you exercises to help keep your joints flexible. The therapist may also suggest new ways to do daily tasks, which will be easier on your joints. For example, if your fingers are sore, you may want to pick up an object using your forearms. Assistive devices can make it easier to avoid stressing your painful joints. For instance, a kitchen knife equipped with a saw handle helps protect your finger and wrist joints. Certain tools, such as buttonhooks, can make it easier to get dressed. Catalogs and medical supply stores are good places to look for ideas. Surgery If medications fail to prevent or slow joint damage, you and your doctor may consider surgery to repair damaged joints. Surgery may help restore your ability to use your joint. It can also reduce pain and correct deformities. Rheumatoid arthritis surgery may involve one or more of the following procedures: - Synovectomy. Surgery to remove the inflamed synovium (lining of the joint). Synovectomy can be performed on knees, elbows, wrists, fingers and hips. - Tendon repair. Inflammation and joint damage may cause tendons around your joint to loosen or rupture. Your surgeon may be able to repair the tendons around your joint. - Joint fusion. Surgically fusing a joint may be recommended to stabilize or realign a joint and for pain relief when a joint replacement isn't an option. - Total joint replacement. During joint replacement surgery, your surgeon removes the damaged parts of your joint and inserts a prosthesis made of metal and plastic. Surgery carries a risk of bleeding, infection and pain. Discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor. You can take steps to care for your body if you have rheumatoid arthritis. These self-care measures, when used along with your rheumatoid arthritis medications, can help you manage your signs and symptoms: - Exercise regularly. Gentle exercise can help strengthen the muscles around your joints, and it can help fight fatigue you might feel. Check with your doctor before you start exercising. If you're just getting started, begin by taking a walk. Try swimming or gentle water aerobics. Avoid exercising tender, injured or severely inflamed joints. - Apply heat or cold. Heat can help ease your pain and relax tense, painful muscles. Cold may dull the sensation of pain. Cold also has a numbing effect and decreases muscle spasms. - Relax. Find ways to cope with pain by reducing stress in your life. Techniques such as guided imagery, distraction and muscle relaxation can all be used to control pain. Some common complementary and alternative treatments that have shown promise for rheumatoid arthritis include: - Fish oil. Some preliminary studies have found that fish oil supplements may reduce rheumatoid arthritis pain and stiffness. Side effects can include nausea, belching and a fishy taste in the mouth. Fish oil can interfere with medications, so check with your doctor first. - Plant oils. The seeds of evening primrose, borage and black currant contain a type of fatty acid that may help with rheumatoid arthritis pain and morning stiffness. Side effects may include nausea, diarrhea and gas. Some plant oils can cause liver damage or interfere with medications, so check with your doctor first. - Tai chi. This movement therapy involves gentle exercises and stretches combined with deep breathing. Many people use tai chi to relieve stress in their lives. Small studies have found that tai chi may reduce rheumatoid arthritis pain. When led by a knowledgeable instructor, tai chi is safe. But don't do any moves that cause pain."

        "query": "what the treatment for bronchitis",
        "document": "Bronchitis: Bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from your lungs. People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored. Bronchitis may be either acute or chronic. Often developing from a cold or other respiratory infection, acute bronchitis is very common. Chronic bronchitis, a more serious condition, is a constant irritation or inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, often due to smoking. Acute bronchitis, also called a chest cold, usually improves within a week to 10 days without lasting effects, although the cough may linger for weeks. However, if you have repeated bouts of bronchitis, you may have chronic bronchitis, which requires medical attention. Chronic bronchitis is one of the conditions included in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For either acute bronchitis or chronic bronchitis, signs and symptoms may include: - Cough   - Production of mucus (sputum), which can be clear, white, yellowish-gray or green in color - rarely, it may be streaked with blood   - Fatigue   - Shortness of breath   - Slight fever and chills   - Chest discomfort If you have acute bronchitis, you might have cold symptoms, such as a mild headache or body aches. While these symptoms usually improve in about a week, you may have a nagging cough that lingers for several weeks. Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough that lasts at least three months, with recurring bouts occurring for at least two consecutive years. If you have chronic bronchitis, you're likely to have periods when your cough or other symptoms worsen. At those times, you may have an acute infection on top of chronic bronchitis. See your doctor if your cough: - Lasts more than three weeks   - Prevents you from sleeping   - Is accompanied by fever higher than 100.4 F (38 C)   - Produces discolored mucus   - Produces blood   - Is associated with wheezing or shortness of breath Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses, typically the same viruses that cause colds and flu (influenza). Antibiotics don't kill viruses, so this type of medication isn't useful in most cases of bronchitis. The most common cause of chronic bronchitis is cigarette smoking. Air pollution and dust or toxic gases in the environment or workplace also can contribute to the condition. Factors that increase your risk of bronchitis include: - Cigarette smoke. People who smoke or who live with a smoker are at higher risk of both acute bronchitis and chronic bronchitis.   - Low resistance. This may result from another acute illness, such as a cold, or from a chronic condition that compromises your immune system. Older adults, infants and young children have greater vulnerability to infection.   - Exposure to irritants on the job. Your risk of developing bronchitis is greater if you work around certain lung irritants, such as grains or textiles, or are exposed to chemical fumes.   - Gastric reflux. Repeated bouts of severe heartburn can irritate your throat and make you more prone to developing bronchitis. Although a single episode of bronchitis usually isn't cause for concern, it can lead to pneumonia in some people. Repeated bouts of bronchitis, however, may mean that you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). During the first few days of illness, it can be difficult to distinguish the signs and symptoms of bronchitis from those of a common cold. During the physical exam, your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen closely to your lungs as you breathe. In some cases, your doctor may suggest the following tests: - Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can help determine if you have pneumonia or another condition that may explain your cough. This is especially important if you ever were or currently are a smoker. - Sputum tests. Sputum is the mucus that you cough up from your lungs. It can be tested to see if you have illnesses that could be helped by antibiotics. Sputum can also be tested for signs of allergies. - Pulmonary function test. During a pulmonary function test, you blow into a device called a spirometer, which measures how much air your lungs can hold and how quickly you can get air out of your lungs. This test checks for signs of asthma or emphysema. Most cases of acute bronchitis get better without treatment, usually within a couple of weeks. Medications Because most cases of bronchitis are caused by viral infections, antibiotics aren't effective. However, if your doctor suspects that you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe an antibiotic. In some circumstances, your doctor may recommend other medications, including: - Cough medicine. If your cough keeps you from sleeping, you might try cough suppressants at bedtime. - Other medications. If you have allergies, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), your doctor may recommend an inhaler and other medications to reduce inflammation and open narrowed passages in your lungs. Therapies If you have chronic bronchitis, you may benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation - a breathing exercise program in which a respiratory therapist teaches you how to breathe more easily and increase your ability to exercise. To help you feel better, you may want to try the following self-care measures: - Avoid lung irritants. Don't smoke. Wear a mask when the air is polluted or if you're exposed to irritants, such as paint or household cleaners with strong fumes. - Use a humidifier. Warm, moist air helps relieve coughs and loosens mucus in your airways. But be sure to clean the humidifier according to the manufacturer's recommendations to avoid the growth of bacteria and fungi in the water container. - Consider a face mask outside. If cold air aggravates your cough and causes shortness of breath, put on a cold-air face mask before you go outside."

Exposure to dusts, fumes, strong acids, and other chemicals in the air causes this type of bronchitis. Smoking may also contribute.   You may be at risk if you are exposed to dusts that contain:     - Asbestos   - Coal   - Cotton   - Flax   - Latex   - Metals   - Silica   - Talc   - Toluene diisocyanate   - Western red cedar Symptoms may include any of the following:     - Cough that brings up mucus (sputum)   - Shortness of breath   - Wheezing The health care provider will listen to your lungs using a stethoscope. Wheezing sounds or crackles may be heard.   Tests that may be ordered include:     - Chest CT scan   - Chest x-ray   - Pulmonary function tests (to measure breathing and how well the lungs are functioning) The goal of treatment is to reduce the irritation.   Getting more air into the workplace or wearing masks to filter out the offending dust particles may help. Some people may need to be taken out of the workplace.   Some cases of industrial bronchitis go away without treatment. Other times, a person may need inhaled anti-inflammatory medicines. If you are at risk or have experienced this problem and you smoke, stop smoking.   Helpful measures include:     - Breathing humidified air   - Increasing fluid intake   - Resting The outcome may be good as long as you can stop being exposed to the irritant. Chronic disability from industrial bronchitis is rare. Continued exposure to irritating gases, fumes, or other substances can lead to permanent lung damage. Call your provider if you are regularly exposed to dusts, fumes, strong acids, or other chemicals that can affect the lungs and you develop symptoms of bronchitis. Control dust in industrial settings by wearing face masks and protective clothing, and by treating textiles. Stop smoking if you are at risk.   Get early screening by a doctor if you are exposed to chemicals that can cause this condition.   If you think a chemical you work with is affecting your breathing, ask your employer for a copy of the Material Safety Data Sheet. Bring it with you to your provider.

        "document": "Bronchitis (Living With): If you have chronic bronchitis, you can take steps to control your symptoms. Lifestyle changes and ongoing care can help you manage the condition. Lifestyle Changes The most important step is to not start smoking or to quit smoking. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. Also, try to avoid other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. This will help keep your lungs healthy. Wash your hands often to lower your risk for a viral or bacterial infection. Also, try to stay away from people who have colds or the flu. See your doctor right away if you have signs or symptoms of a cold or the flu. Follow a healthy diet and be as physically active as you can. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, and fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products. A healthy diet also is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBI's Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site, \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart,\" and \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH.\" All of these resources include general advice about healthy eating. Ongoing Care See your doctor regularly and take all of your medicines as prescribed. Also, talk with your doctor about getting a yearly flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If you have chronic bronchitis, you may benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. People who have chronic bronchitis often breathe fast. Talk with your doctor about a breathing method called pursed-lip breathing. This method decreases how often you take breaths, and it helps keep your airways open longer. This allows more air to flow in and out of your lungs so you can be more physically active. To do pursed-lip breathing, you breathe in through your nostrils. Then you slowly breathe out through slightly pursed lips, as if you're blowing out a candle. You exhale two to three times longer than you inhale. Some people find it helpful to count to two while inhaling and to four or six while exhaling."

        "document": "Bronchitis: Espa\u00f1ol Bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) is a condition in which the bronchial tubes become inflamed. These tubes carry air to your lungs. (For more information about the bronchial tubes and airways, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index How the Lungs Work article.) People who have bronchitis often have a cough that brings up mucus. Mucus is a slimy substance made by the lining of the bronchial tubes. Bronchitis also may cause wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), chest pain or discomfort, a low fever, and shortness of breath. Bronchitis Overview The two main types of bronchitis are acute (short term) and chronic (ongoing). Acute Bronchitis Infections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. These viruses are spread through the air when people cough. They also are spread through physical contact (for example, on hands that have not been washed). Sometimes bacteria cause acute bronchitis. Acute bronchitis lasts from a few days to 10 days. However, coughing may last for several weeks after the infection is gone. Several factors increase your risk for acute bronchitis. Examples include exposure to tobacco smoke (including secondhand smoke), dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. Avoiding these lung irritants as much as possible can help lower your risk for acute bronchitis. Most cases of acute bronchitis go away within a few days. If you think you have acute bronchitis, see your doctor. He or she will want to rule out other, more serious health conditions that require medical care. Chronic Bronchitis Chronic bronchitis is an ongoing, serious condition. It occurs if the lining of the bronchial tubes is constantly irritated and inflamed, causing a long-term cough with mucus. Smoking is the main cause of chronic bronchitis. Viruses or bacteria can easily infect the irritated bronchial tubes. If this happens, the condition worsens and lasts longer. As a result, people who have chronic bronchitis have periods when symptoms get much worse than usual. Chronic bronchitis is a serious, long-term medical condition. Early diagnosis and treatment, combined with quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke, can improve quality of life. The chance of complete recovery is low for people who have severe chronic bronchitis. Acute bronchitis Chronic bronchitis Industrial bronchitis Acute Bronchitis Infections or lung irritants cause acute bronchitis. The same viruses that cause colds and the flu are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. Sometimes bacteria can cause the condition. Certain substances can irritate your lungs and airways and raise your risk for acute bronchitis. For example, inhaling or being exposed to tobacco smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, or air pollution raises your risk for the condition. These lung irritants also can make symptoms worse. Being exposed to a high level of dust or fumes, such as from an explosion or a big fire, also may lead to acute bronchitis. Chronic Bronchitis Repeatedly breathing in fumes that irritate and damage lung and airway tissues causes chronic bronchitis. Smoking is the major cause of the condition. Breathing in air pollution and dust or fumes from the environment or workplace also can lead to chronic bronchitis. People who have chronic bronchitis go through periods when symptoms become much worse than usual. During these times, they also may have acute viral or bacterial bronchitis. Bronchitis is a very common condition. Millions of cases occur every year. Elderly people, infants, and young children are at higher risk for acute bronchitis than people in other age groups. People of all ages can develop chronic bronchitis, but it occurs more often in people who are older than 45. Also, many adults who develop chronic bronchitis are smokers. Women are more than twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis. Smoking and having an existing lung disease greatly increase your risk for bronchitis. Contact with dust, chemical fumes, and vapors from certain jobs also increases your risk for the condition. Examples include jobs in coal mining, textile manufacturing, grain handling, and livestock farming. Air pollution, infections, and allergies can worsen the symptoms of chronic bronchitis, especially if you smoke. Acute Bronchitis Acute bronchitis caused by an infection usually develops after you already have a cold or the flu. Symptoms of a cold or the flu include sore throat, fatigue (tiredness), fever, body aches, stuffy or runny nose, vomiting, and diarrhea. The main symptom of acute bronchitis is a persistent cough, which may last 10 to 20 days. The cough may produce clear mucus (a slimy substance). If the mucus is yellow or green, you may have a bacterial infection as well. Even after the infection clears up, you may still have a dry cough for days or weeks. Other symptoms of acute bronchitis include wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe), low fever, and chest tightness or pain. If your acute bronchitis is severe, you also may have shortness of breath, especially with physical activity. Chronic Bronchitis The signs and symptoms of chronic bronchitis include coughing, wheezing, and chest discomfort. The coughing may produce large amounts of mucus. This type of cough often is called a smoker's cough. Your doctor usually will diagnose bronchitis based on your signs and symptoms. He or she may ask questions about your cough, such as how long you've had it, what you're coughing up, and how much you cough. Your doctor also will likely ask: About your medical history Whether you've recently had a cold or the flu Whether you smoke or spend time around others who smoke Whether you've been exposed to dust, fumes, vapors, or air pollution Your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen for wheezing (a whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe) or other abnormal sounds in your lungs. He or she also may: Look at your mucus to see whether you have a bacterial infection Test the oxygen levels in your blood using a sensor attached to your fingertip or toe Recommend a chest x ray, lung function tests, or blood tests The main goals of treating acute and chronic bronchitis are to relieve symptoms and make breathing easier. If you have acute bronchitis, your doctor may recommend rest, plenty of fluids, and aspirin (for adults) or acetaminophen to treat fever. Antibiotics usually aren't prescribed for acute bronchitis. This is because they don't work against viruses\u2014the most common cause of acute bronchitis. However, if your doctor thinks you have a bacterial infection, he or she may prescribe antibiotics. A humidifier or steam can help loosen mucus and relieve wheezing and limited air flow. If your bronchitis causes wheezing, you may need an inhaled medicine to open your airways. You take this medicine using an inhaler. This device allows the medicine to go straight to your lungs. Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to relieve or reduce your cough and treat your inflamed airways (especially if your cough persists). If you have chronic bronchitis and also have been diagnosed with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), you may need medicines to open your airways and help clear away mucus. These medicines include bronchodilators (inhaled) and steroids (inhaled or pill form). If you have chronic bronchitis, your doctor may prescribe oxygen therapy. This treatment can help you breathe easier, and it provides your body with needed oxygen. One of the best ways to treat acute and chronic bronchitis is to remove the source of irritation and damage to your lungs. If you smoke, it's very important to quit. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit smoking. Try to avoid secondhand smoke and other lung irritants, such as dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. You can't always prevent acute or chronic bronchitis. However, you can take steps to lower your risk for both conditions. The most important step is to quit smoking or not start smoking. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. Also, try to avoid other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. For example, wear a mask over your mouth and nose when you use paint, paint remover, varnish, or other substances with strong fumes. This will help protect your lungs. Wash your hands often to limit your exposure to germs and bacteria. Your doctor also may advise you to get a yearly flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If you have chronic bronchitis, you can take steps to control your symptoms. Lifestyle changes and ongoing care can help you manage the condition. Lifestyle Changes The most important step is to not start smoking or to quit smoking. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. Also, try to avoid other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. This will help keep your lungs healthy. Wash your hands often to lower your risk for a viral or bacterial infection. Also, try to stay away from people who have colds or the flu. See your doctor right away if you have signs or symptoms of a cold or the flu. Follow a healthy diet and be as physically active as you can. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, and fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products. A healthy diet also is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBI's Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site, \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart,\" and \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH.\" All of these resources include general advice about healthy eating. Ongoing Care See your doctor regularly and take all of your medicines as prescribed. Also, talk with your doctor about getting a yearly flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If you have chronic bronchitis, you may benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. People who have chronic bronchitis often breathe fast. Talk with your doctor about a breathing method called pursed-lip breathing. This method decreases how often you take breaths, and it helps keep your airways open longer. This allows more air to flow in and out of your lungs so you can be more physically active. To do pursed-lip breathing, you breathe in through your nostrils. Then you slowly breathe out through slightly pursed lips, as if you're blowing out a candle. You exhale two to three times longer than you inhale. Some people find it helpful to count to two while inhaling and to four or six while exhaling."

        "query": "what treatment do you use to cure chickenpox",
        "document": "What are the treatments for Chickenpox?: Treatment involves keeping the person as comfortable as possible. Here are things to try:  - Avoid scratching or rubbing the itchy areas. Keep fingernails short to avoid damaging the skin from scratching.  - Wear cool, light, loose bedclothes. Avoid wearing rough clothing, particularly wool, over an itchy area.  - Take lukewarm baths using little soap and rinse thoroughly. Try a skin-soothing oatmeal or cornstarch bath.  - Apply a soothing moisturizer after bathing to soften and cool the skin.  - Avoid prolonged exposure to excessive heat and humidity.  - Try over-the-counter oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), but be aware of possible side effects, such as drowsiness.  - Try over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream on itchy areas.   Medicines that fight the chickenpox virus are available, but not given to everyone. To work well, the medicine should be started within the first 24 hours of the rash.  - Antiviral drugs are not very often prescribed to otherwise healthy children who do not have severe symptoms. Adults and teens, who are at risk for more severe symptoms, may benefit from antiviral medicine if it is given early.  - Antiviral medicine may be very important forthose who have skin conditions (such as eczema or recent sunburn), lung conditions (such as asthma), or who have recently taken steroids.  - Some providers also give antiviral medicines to people in the same household who also develop chickenpox, because they will most often develop more severe symptoms.   Do NOT give aspirin or ibuprofen to someone who may have chickenpox. Use of aspirin has been associated with a serious condition called Reyes syndrome. Ibuprofen has been associated with more severe secondary infections. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used.  A child with chickenpox should not return to school or play with other children until all chickenpox sores have crusted over or dried out. Adults should follow this same rule while considering when to return to work or be around others."

        "query": "what treatment do you use to cure chickenpox",
        "document": "Chickenpox: Chickenpox (varicella) is a viral infection that causes an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. Chickenpox is highly contagious to people who haven't had the disease or been vaccinated against it. Before routine chickenpox vaccination, virtually all people had been infected by the time they reached adulthood, sometimes with serious complications. Today, the number of cases and hospitalizations is down dramatically. For most people, chickenpox is a mild disease. Still, it's better to get vaccinated. The chickenpox vaccine is a safe, effective way to prevent chickenpox and its possible complications. Chickenpox infection appears 10 to 21 days after exposure to the virus and usually lasts about five to 10 days. The rash is the telltale indication of chickenpox. Other signs and symptoms, which may appear one to two days before the rash, include: - Fever   - Loss of appetite   - Headache   - Tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell (malaise) Once the chickenpox rash appears, it goes through three phases: - Raised pink or red bumps (papules), which break out over several days   - Small fluid-filled blisters (vesicles), forming from the raised bumps over about one day before breaking and leaking   - Crusts and scabs, which cover the broken blisters and take several more days to heal New bumps continue to appear for several days. As a result, you may have all three stages of the rash - bumps, blisters and scabbed lesions - at the same time on the second day of the rash. Once infected, you can spread the virus for up to 48 hours before the rash appears, and you remain contagious until all spots crust over. The disease is generally mild in healthy children. In severe cases, the rash can spread to cover the entire body, and lesions may form in the throat, eyes and mucous membranes of the urethra, anus and vagina. New spots continue to appear for several days. When to see a doctor If you suspect that you or your child has chickenpox, consult your doctor. He or she usually can diagnose chickenpox by examining the rash and by noting the presence of accompanying symptoms. Your doctor can also prescribe medications to lessen the severity of chickenpox and treat complications, if necessary. Be sure to call ahead for an appointment and mention you think you or your child has chickenpox, to avoid waiting and possibly infecting others in a waiting room. Also, be sure to let your doctor know if any of these complications occur: - The rash spreads to one or both eyes.   - The rash gets very red, warm or tender, indicating a possible secondary bacterial skin infection.   - The rash is accompanied by dizziness, disorientation, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, tremors, loss of muscle coordination, worsening cough, vomiting, stiff neck or a fever higher than 102 F (38.9 C).   - Anyone in the household is immune deficient or younger than 6 months old. Chickenpox, which is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, is highly contagious, and it can spread quickly. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the rash or by droplets dispersed into the air by coughing or sneezing. Your risk of catching chickenpox is higher if you: - Haven't had chickenpox   - Haven't been vaccinated for chickenpox   - Work in or attend a school or child care facility   - Live with children Most people who have had chickenpox or have been vaccinated against chickenpox are immune to chickenpox. If you've been vaccinated and still get chickenpox, symptoms are often milder, with fewer blisters and mild or no fever. A few people can get chickenpox more than once, but this is rare. Chickenpox is normally a mild disease. But it can be serious and can lead to complications or death, especially in high-risk people. Complications include: - Bacterial infections of the skin, soft tissues, bones, joints or bloodstream (sepsis)   - Dehydration   - Pneumonia   - Inflammation of the brain (encephalitis)   - Toxic shock syndrome   - Reye's syndrome for people who take aspirin during chickenpox Who's at risk? Those at high risk of having complications from chickenpox include: - Newborns and infants whose mothers never had chickenpox or the vaccine   - Adults   - Pregnant women who haven't had chickenpox   - People whose immune systems are impaired by medication, such as chemotherapy, or another disease, such as cancer or HIV   - People who are taking steroid medications for another disease or condition, such as children with asthma   - People taking drugs that suppress their immune systems Chickenpox and pregnancy Other complications of chickenpox affect pregnant women. Chickenpox early in pregnancy can result in a variety of problems in a newborn, including low birth weight and birth defects, such as limb abnormalities. A greater threat to a baby occurs when the mother develops chickenpox in the week before birth or within a couple of days after giving birth. Then it can cause a serious, life-threatening infection in a newborn. If you're pregnant and not immune to chickenpox, talk to your doctor about the risks to you and your unborn child. Chickenpox and shingles If you've had chickenpox, you're at risk of another disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus called shingles. After a chickenpox infection, some of the varicella-zoster virus may remain in your nerve cells. Many years later, the virus can reactivate and resurface as shingles - a painful band of short-lived blisters. The virus is more likely to reappear in older adults and people with weakened immune systems. Shingles can lead to its own complication - a condition in which the pain of shingles persists long after the blisters disappear. This complication, called postherpetic neuralgia, can be severe. A shingles vaccine (Zostavax) is available and is recommended for adults age 60 and older who have had chickenpox. Doctors generally diagnose chickenpox based on the telltale rash. If there's any doubt about the diagnosis, chickenpox can be confirmed with laboratory tests, including blood tests or a culture of lesion samples. In otherwise healthy children, chickenpox typically requires no medical treatment. Your doctor may prescribe an antihistamine to relieve itching. But for the most part, the disease is allowed to run its course. If you're at high risk of complications For people who have a high risk of complications from chickenpox, doctors sometimes prescribe medications to shorten the duration of the infection and to help reduce the risk of complications.

        "query": "who is at risk for contracting dengue fever? is there a certain age group or race that contracts dengue fever?",
        "document": "Dengue fever (Summary): The following summary is from Orphanet, a European reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs. Orpha Number: 99828 Disease definition Dengue fever (DF), caused by dengue virus , is an arboviral disease characterized by an initial non-specific febrile illness that can sometimes progress to more severe forms manifesting capillary leakage and hemorrhage (dengue hemorrhagic fever, or DHF) and shock (dengue shock syndrome , or DSS). Epidemiology DF is found in the tropics worldwide, especially in Southeast Asia, the Pacific region, and the Americas, with 40% of the global population at risk. An estimated 50 to 100 million cases of DF, 500,000 hospitalizations, and 20,000 deaths occur yearly worldwide. Clinical description The vast majority of dengue virus infections result in DF, which is characterized by sudden onset of fever, malaise, headache (classically retro-orbital), and myalgia/arthralgia, often followed soon after by a petechial rash, which may be pruritic. In most cases, symptoms will resolve within 7 days without further complications. However, in a small minority of patients, a brief period of deffervescence is followed by worsening abdominal symptoms (pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), thrombocytopenia , hemorrhage (DHF: epistaxis, bleeding gums, gastrointestinal bleeding) and a capillary leak syndrome (DSS: hemoconcentration, hypoalbuminemia, pleural effusion, shock). DHF/DSS are seen most often in children under the age of 15 years. Risk is greater with secondary heterologous infection by one of the four dengue virus serotypes, but severe disease may be seen with first infections. Etiology Over 25 different viruses cause viral hemorrhagic fever. Dengue virus belongs to the Flaviviridae family, genus Flavivirus. Four distinct serotypes, with significant strain variation, are recognized. Dengue viruses are maintained in humans and transmitted between them by the bite of infected mosquitoes, most commonly Aedes aegypti but also Aedes albopictus). Person-to-person transmission has not been reported. Diagnostic methods Common diagnostic modalities include serologic testing by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Virus isolation may also be performed in specialized laboratories. The viremic phase of DF/DHF is usually brief (first 3-5 days of illness), after which time detection of anti-dengue IgM antibodies , which appear as early as 2-4 days after disease onset, is the mainstay. Numerous commercial ELISA assays are available with varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity. Differential diagnosis DF is difficult to distinguish from a host of other febrile illnesses such as malaria and typhoid fever (see these terms), especially early in the course of disease before the rash appears. For DHF/DSS, other viral hemorrhagic fevers, leptospirosis, rickettsial infection (see these terms) and meningococcemia need to be excluded. Management and treatment As there is presently no antiviral drug available for DF/DHF, treatment is supportive, following the guidelines for treatment of severe septicemia. Insecticide-treated bed nets, room screens and elimination of larval development sites should be used in open-air settings to prevent further transmission. Prognosis Case-fatality rates for DF are less than 1% but may rise to as high as 40% in DHF/DSS, largely dependent upon whether access to advanced medical care exists. Children and persons with underlying chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and asthma are at increased risk. The most severe phase of disease usually lasts only a few days and survivors generally have no lasting sequelae. Visit the Orphanet disease page for more resources."

        "document": "Felodipine: Felodipine is used to treat high blood pressure. Felodipine is in a class of medications called calcium channel blockers. It works by relaxing the blood vessels so your heart does not have to pump as hard.   High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation. Felodipine comes as an extended release tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day. To help you remember to take felodipine, take it around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take felodipine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.   Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.   Felodipine controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take felodipine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking felodipine without talking to your doctor. This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

        "query": "can i take keflex to cure staph?",
        "document": "Staph infections (Treatment): Treatment of a staph infection may include: - Antibiotics. Your doctor may perform tests to identify of the staph bacteria behind your infection, and to help choose the antibiotic that will work best. Antibiotics commonly prescribed to treat staph infections include certain cephalosporins, nafcillin or related antibiotics, sulfa drugs, or vancomycin. Vancomycin increasingly is required to treat serious staph infections because so many strains of staph bacteria have become resistant to other traditional medicines. But vancomycin and some other antibiotics have to be given intravenously. If you're given an oral antibiotic, be sure to take it as directed, and to finish all of the medication prescribed by your doctor. Ask your doctor what signs and symptoms you should watch for that might indicate your infection is worsening. - Wound drainage. If you have a skin infection, your doctor will likely make an incision into the sore to drain fluid that has collected there. - Device removal. If your infection involves a device or prosthetic, prompt removal of the device is needed. For some devices, removal might require surgery. Antibiotic resistance Staph bacteria are very adaptable, and many varieties have become resistant to one or more antibiotics. For example, only about 10 percent of today's staph infections can be cured with penicillin. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of staph bacteria - often described as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains - has led to the use of IV antibiotics, such as vancomycin, with the potential for more side effects, such as vancomycin."

        "document": "Staph infections: Staph infections are caused by staphylococcus bacteria, types of germs commonly found on the skin or in the nose of even healthy individuals. Most of the time, these bacteria cause no problems or result in relatively minor skin infections. But staph infections can turn deadly if the bacteria invade deeper into your body, entering your bloodstream, joints, bones, lungs or heart. A growing number of otherwise healthy people are developing life-threatening staph infections. Treatment usually involves antibiotics and drainage of the infected area. However, some staph infections no longer respond to common antibiotics. Staph infections can range from minor skin problems to endocarditis, a life-threatening infection of the inner lining of your heart (endocardium). As a result, signs and symptoms of staph infections vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the infection. Skin infections caused by staph bacteria include: -   Boils. The most common type of staph infection is the boil, a pocket of pus that develops in a hair follicle or oil gland. The skin over the infected area usually becomes red and swollen.  If a boil breaks open, it will probably drain pus. Boils occur most often under the arms or around the groin or buttocks.    - Impetigo. This contagious, often painful rash can be caused by staph bacteria. Impetigo usually features large blisters that may ooze fluid and develop a honey-colored crust.   - Cellulitis. Cellulitis - an infection of the deeper layers of skin - causes skin redness and swelling on the surface of your skin. Sores (ulcers) or areas of oozing discharge may develop, too.   - Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Toxins produced as a result of a staph infection may lead to staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Affecting mostly babies and children, this condition features fever, a rash and sometimes blisters. When the blisters break, the top layer of skin comes off - leaving a red, raw surface that looks like a burn. Staph bacteria are one of the most common causes of food poisoning. Symptoms come on quickly, usually within hours of eating a contaminated food. Symptoms usually disappear quickly, too, often lasting just half a day. A staph infection in food usually doesn't cause a fever. Signs and symptoms you can expect with this type of staph infection include: - Nausea and vomiting   - Diarrhea   - Dehydration   - Low blood pressure Also known as blood poisoning, septicemia occurs when staph bacteria enter a person's bloodstream. A fever and low blood pressure are signs of septicemia. The bacteria can travel to locations deep within your body, to produce infections affecting: - Internal organs, such as your brain, heart or lungs   - Bones and muscles   - Surgically implanted devices, such as artificial joints or cardiac pacemakers This life-threatening condition results from toxins produced by some strains of staph bacteria and has been linked to certain types of tampons, skin wounds and surgery. It usually develops suddenly with: - A high fever   - Nausea and vomiting   - A rash on your palms and soles that resembles sunburn   - Confusion   - Muscle aches   - Diarrhea   - Abdominal pain Septic arthritis is often caused by a staph infection. The bacteria often target the knees, shoulders, hips, and fingers or toes. Signs and symptoms may include: - Joint swelling   - Severe pain in the affected joint   - Fever Go to the doctor if you or your child has: - An area of red, irritated or painful skin   - Pus-filled blisters   - Fever You may also want to consult your doctor if: - Skin infections are being passed from one family member to another   - Two or more family members have skin infections at the same time Many people carry staph bacteria and never develop staph infections. However, if you develop a staph infection, there's a good chance that it's from bacteria you've been carrying around for some time. These bacteria can also be transmitted from person to person. Because staph bacteria are so hardy, they can live on inanimate objects such as pillowcases or towels long enough to transfer to the next person who touches them. Staph bacteria are able to survive: - Drying   - Extremes of temperature   - Stomach acid   - High levels of salt A variety of factors - including the status of your immune system to the types of sports you play - can increase your risk of developing staph infections. Certain disorders or the medications used to treat them can make you more susceptible to staph infections. People who may be more likely to get a staph infection include those with: - Diabetes who use insulin   - HIV/AIDS   - Kidney failure requiring dialysis   - Weakened immune systems - either from a disease or medications that suppress the immune system   - Cancer, especially those who are undergoing chemotherapy or radiation   - Skin damage from conditions such as eczema, insect bites or minor trauma that opens the skin   - Respiratory illness, such as cystic fibrosis or emphysema Despite vigorous attempts to eradicate them, staph bacteria remain present in hospitals, where they attack the most vulnerable, including people with: - Weakened immune systems   - Burns   - Surgical wounds Staph bacteria can travel along the medical tubing that connects the outside world with your internal organs. Examples include: - Dialysis tubing   - Urinary catheters   - Feeding tubes   - Breathing tubes   - Intravascular catheters Staph bacteria can spread easily through cuts, abrasions and skin-to-skin contact. Staph infections may also spread in the locker room through shared razors, towels, uniforms or equipment. Food handlers who don't properly wash their hands can transfer staph from their skin to the food they're preparing. Foods that are contaminated with staph look and taste normal. If staph bacteria invade your bloodstream, you may develop a type of infection that affects your entire body. Called sepsis, this infection can lead to septic shock - a life-threatening episode with extremely low blood pressure. To diagnose a staph infection, your doctor will: - Perform a physical exam. During the exam, your doctor will closely examine any skin lesions you may have. - Collect a sample for testing. Most often, doctors diagnose staph infections by checking a tissue sample or nasal secretions for signs of the bacteria. Treatment of a staph infection may include: - Antibiotics. Your doctor may perform tests to identify of the staph bacteria behind your infection, and to help choose the antibiotic that will work best. Antibiotics commonly prescribed to treat staph infections include certain cephalosporins, nafcillin or related antibiotics, sulfa drugs, or vancomycin.

For example, only about 10 percent of today's staph infections can be cured with penicillin. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of staph bacteria - often described as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains - has led to the use of IV antibiotics, such as vancomycin, with the potential for more side effects, such as vancomycin."

        "query": "could tetanus be a cause of death?",
        "document": "Tetanus: Tetanus is a serious bacterial disease that affects your nervous system, leading to painful muscle contractions, particularly of your jaw and neck muscles. Tetanus can interfere with your ability to breathe and can threaten your life. Tetanus is commonly known as \"lockjaw.\" Thanks to the tetanus vaccine, cases of tetanus are rare in the United States and other parts of the developed world. However, the disease remains a threat to those who aren't up to date on their vaccinations, and is more common in developing countries. There's no cure for tetanus. Treatment focuses on managing complications until the effects of the tetanus toxin resolve. Signs and symptoms of tetanus appear anytime from a few days to several weeks after tetanus bacteria enter your body through a wound. The average incubation period is seven to 10 days. Common signs and symptoms of tetanus include: - Spasms and stiffness in your jaw muscles (trismus)   - Stiffness of your neck muscles   - Difficulty swallowing   - Stiffness of your abdominal muscles   - Painful body spasms lasting for several minutes, typically triggered by minor occurrences, such as a draft, loud noise, physical touch or light Possible other signs and symptoms include: - Fever   - Sweating   - Elevated blood pressure   - Rapid heart rate See your doctor for a tetanus booster shot if you have a deep or dirty wound and you haven't had a booster shot in five years. If you aren't sure of when your last booster was, get a booster. Or see your doctor about a tetanus booster for any wound - especially if it might have been contaminated with dirt, animal feces or manure - if you haven't had a booster shot within the past 10 years or aren't sure of when you were last vaccinated. Spores of the bacteria that cause tetanus, Clostridium tetani, are found in soil, dust and animal feces. When they enter a deep flesh wound, spores grow into bacteria that can produce a powerful toxin, tetanospasmin, which impairs the nerves that control your muscles (motor neurons). The toxin can cause muscle stiffness and spasms - the major signs of tetanus. Nearly all cases of tetanus occur in people who have never been vaccinated or adults who haven't kept up with their 10-year booster shots. You can't catch tetanus from a person who has it. The following increase your likelihood of getting tetanus: - Failure to get vaccinated or to keep up to date with booster shots against tetanus   - An injury that lets tetanus spores into the wound   - A foreign body, such as a nail or splinter Tetanus cases have developed from the following: - Puncture wounds - including from splinters, body piercings, tattoos, injection drugs   - Gunshot wounds   - Compound fractures   - Burns   - Surgical wounds   - Injection drug use   - Animal or insect bites   - Infected foot ulcers   - Dental infections   - Infected umbilical stumps in newborns born of inadequately immunized mothers Once tetanus toxin has bonded to your nerve endings it is impossible to remove. Complete recovery from a tetanus infection requires new nerve endings to grow, which can take up to several months. Complications of tetanus infection may include: - Broken bones. The severity of spasms may cause the spine and other bones to break.   - Blockage of a lung artery (pulmonary embolism). A blood clot that has traveled from elsewhere in your body can block the main artery of the lung or one of its branches.   - Death. Severe tetanus-induced (tetanic) muscle spasms can interfere with or stop your breathing. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. Lack of oxygen may also induce cardiac arrest and death. Pneumonia is another cause of death. Doctors diagnose tetanus based on a physical exam, medical and immunization history, and the signs and symptoms of muscle spasms, stiffness and pain. Laboratory tests generally aren't helpful for diagnosing tetanus. Since there's no cure for tetanus, treatment consists of wound care, medications to ease symptoms and supportive care. Wound care Cleaning the wound is essential to preventing growth of tetanus spores. This involves removing dirt, foreign objects and dead tissue from the wound. Medications - Antitoxin. Your doctor may give you a tetanus antitoxin, such as tetanus immune globulin. However, the antitoxin can neutralize only toxin that hasn't yet bonded to nerve tissue. - Antibiotics. Your doctor may also give you antibiotics, either orally or by injection, to fight tetanus bacteria. - Vaccine. All people with tetanus should receive the tetanus vaccine as soon as they're diagnosed with the condition. - Sedatives. Doctors generally use powerful sedatives to control muscle spasms. - Other drugs. Other medications, such as magnesium sulfate and certain beta blockers, might be used to regulate involuntary muscle activity, such as your heartbeat and breathing. Morphine might be used for this purpose as well as sedation. Supportive therapies Severe tetanus infection often requires a long stay in an intensive care setting. Since sedatives can inhibit breathing, you might temporarily need a ventilator. Puncture wounds or other deep cuts, animal bites, or particularly dirty wounds put you at increased risk of tetanus infection. Get medical attention if the wound is deep and dirty, and particularly if you're unsure of when you were last vaccinated. Leave unclean wounds open to avoid trapping bacteria in the wound with a bandage. Your doctor may need to clean the wound, prescribe an antibiotic and give you a booster shot of the tetanus toxoid vaccine. If you've previously been immunized, your body should quickly make the needed antibodies to protect you against tetanus. If you have a minor wound, these steps will help prevent tetanus: - Control bleeding. Apply direct pressure to control bleeding. - Keep the wound clean. After the bleeding stops, rinse the wound thoroughly with clean running water. Clean the area around the wound with soap and a washcloth. If something is embedded in a wound, see your doctor. - Use an antibiotic. After you clean the wound, apply a thin layer of an antibiotic cream or ointment, such as the multi-ingredient antibiotics Neosporin and Polysporin. These antibiotics won't make the wound heal faster, but they can discourage bacterial growth and infection. Certain ingredients in some ointments can cause a mild rash in some people. If a rash appears, stop using the ointment. - Cover the wound. Exposure to the air might speed healing, but bandages can keep the wound clean and keep harmful bacteria out. Blisters that are draining are vulnerable. Keep them covered until a scab forms. - Change the dressing. Apply a new dressing at least once a day or whenever the dressing becomes wet or dirty to help prevent infection. If you're allergic to the adhesive used in most bandages, switch to adhesive-free dressings or sterile gauze and paper tape."

        "document": "Lewy body dementia (Treatment): Treatment can be challenging, and there's no cure for Lewy body dementia. Doctors treat the individual symptoms. Medications - Cholinesterase inhibitors. These Alzheimer's disease medications, such as rivastigmine (Exelon), work by increasing the levels of chemical messengers believed to be important for memory, thought and judgment (neurotransmitters) in the brain. This can help improve alertness and cognition, and may help reduce hallucinations and other behavioral problems. Possible side effects may include gastrointestinal upset, excessive salivation and tearing, and frequent urination. These are not FDA approved for Lewy body dementia. - Parkinson's disease medications. These medications, such as carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) may help reduce parkinsonian symptoms, such as rigid muscles and slow movement. However, these medications may also increase confusion, hallucinations and delusions. - Medications to treat other symptoms. Your doctor may prescribe medications to treat other symptoms associated with Lewy body dementia, such as sleep or movement problems. If possible, avoid medications with anticholinergic properties, which can worsen cognition or dopamine agonists, which can cause hallucinations. First-generation antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol (Haldol), should not be used to treat Lewy body dementia. They may cause severe confusion, severe Parkinsonism, sedation and sometimes even death. Very rarely, certain second-generation antipsychotics may be prescribed for a short time at a low dose but only if the benefits outweigh the risks. Therapies Because antipsychotic drugs can worsen Lewy body dementia symptoms, it might be helpful to initially try nondrug approaches, such as: - Tolerating the behavior. Many times a person with Lewy body dementia isn't distressed by the hallucinations. In these cases, the side effects of medication may be worse than the hallucinations themselves. - Modifying the environment. Reducing clutter and distracting noise can make it easier for someone with dementia to function. - Offering soothing responses. A caregiver's response may worsen behavior. Avoid correcting and quizzing a person with dementia. Offer reassurance and validation of his or her concerns. - Creating daily routines and keeping tasks simple. Break tasks into easier steps and focus on successes, not failures. Structure and routine during the day can be less confusing."

        "document": "autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness: Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing and distinguishing objects in low light (night blindness). For example, they may not be able to identify road signs at night or see stars in the night sky. They also often have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), nearsightedness (myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus).   The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is likely a rare disease; however, its prevalence is unknown. Mutations in several genes can cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Each of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the retina. These proteins are involved in sending (transmitting) visual signals from cells called rods, which are specialized for vision in low light, to cells called bipolar cells, which relay the signals to other retinal cells. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain.   Mutations in two genes, GRM6 and TRPM1, cause most cases of this condition. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for bipolar cells to receive and relay signals. Mutations in other genes involved in the same bipolar cell signaling pathway are likely responsible for a small percentage of cases of autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness.   Gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness disrupt the transmission of visual signals between rod cells and bipolar cells or interfere with the bipolar cells' ability to pass on these signals. As a result, visual information received by rod cells cannot be effectively transmitted to the brain, leading to difficulty seeing in low light. The cause of the other vision problems associated with this condition is unclear. It has been suggested that the mechanisms that underlie night blindness can interfere with other visual systems, causing myopia, reduced visual acuity, and other impairments.   Some people with autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness have no identified mutation in any of the known genes. The cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

        "query": "how common is cystic fibrosis",
        "document": "Cystic Fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis (SIS-tik fi-BRO-sis), or CF, is an inherited disease of the secretory (see-KREH-tor-ee) glands. Secretory glands include glands that make mucus and sweat. \"Inherited\" means the disease is passed from parents to children through genes. People who have CF inherit two faulty genes for the disease\u2014one from each parent. The parents likely don't have the disease themselves. CF mainly affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs. Overview Mucus is a substance made by tissues that line some organs and body cavities, such as the lungs and nose. Normally, mucus is a slippery, watery substance. It keeps the linings of certain organs moist and prevents them from drying out or getting infected. If you have CF, your mucus becomes thick and sticky. It builds up in your lungs and blocks your airways. (Airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs.) The buildup of mucus makes it easy for bacteria to grow. This leads to repeated, serious lung infections. Over time, these infections can severely damage your lungs. The thick, sticky mucus also can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). As a result, the digestive enzymes that your pancreas makes can't reach your small intestine. These enzymes help break down food. Without them, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition because nutrients pass through your body without being used. You also may have bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly from severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. CF also causes your sweat to become very salty. Thus, when you sweat, you lose large amounts of salt. This can upset the balance of minerals in your blood and cause many health problems. Examples of these problems include dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. If you or your child has CF, you're also at higher risk for diabetes or two bone-thinning conditions called osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis) and osteopenia (OS-te-o-PEE-nee-uh). CF also causes infertility in men, and the disease can make it harder for women to get pregnant. (The term \"infertility\" refers to the inability to have children.) Outlook The symptoms and severity of CF vary. If you or your child has the disease, you may have serious lung and digestive problems. If the disease is mild, symptoms may not show up until the teen or adult years. The symptoms and severity of CF also vary over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. As the disease gets worse, you'll have more severe symptoms more often. Lung function often starts to decline in early childhood in people who have CF. Over time, damage to the lungs can cause severe breathing problems. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people who have CF. As treatments for CF continue to improve, so does life expectancy for those who have the disease. Today, some people who have CF are living into their forties or fifties, or longer. Early treatment for CF can improve your quality of life and increase your lifespan. Treatments may include nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines, exercise, and other treatments. Your doctor also may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas Fibrocystic disease of the pancreas Mucoviscidosis (MU-ko-vis-ih-DO-sis) Mucoviscidosis of the pancreas Pancreas fibrocystic disease Pancreatic cystic fibrosis A defect in the CFTR gene causes cystic fibrosis (CF). This gene makes a protein that controls the movement of salt and water in and out of your body's cells. In people who have CF, the gene makes a protein that doesn't work well. This causes thick, sticky mucus and very salty sweat. Research suggests that the CFTR protein also affects the body in other ways. This may help explain other symptoms and complications of CF. More than a thousand known defects can affect the CFTR gene. The type of defect you or your child has may affect the severity of CF. Other genes also may play a role in the severity of the disease. How Is Cystic Fibrosis Inherited? Every person inherits two CFTR genes\u2014one from each parent. Children who inherit a faulty CFTR gene from each parent will have CF. Children who inherit one faulty CFTR gene and one normal CFTR gene are \"CF carriers.\" CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, they can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children. The image below shows how two parents who are both CF carriers can pass the faulty CFTR gene to their children. Example of an Inheritance Pattern for Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects both males and females and people from all racial and ethnic groups. However, the disease is most common among Caucasians of Northern European descent. CF also is common among Latinos and American Indians, especially the Pueblo and Zuni. The disease is less common among African Americans and Asian Americans. More than 10 million Americans are carriers of a faulty CF gene. Many of them don't know that they're CF carriers. The signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF) vary from person to person and over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. One of the first signs of CF that parents may notice is that their baby's skin tastes salty when kissed, or the baby doesn't pass stool when first born. Most of the other signs and symptoms of CF happen later. They're related to how CF affects the respiratory, digestive, or reproductive systems of the body. Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory System Signs and Symptoms People who have CF have thick, sticky mucus that builds up in their airways. This buildup of mucus makes it easier for bacteria to grow and cause infections. Infections can block the airways and cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum (spit) or mucus that's sometimes bloody. People who have CF tend to have lung infections caused by unusual germs that don't respond to standard antibiotics. For example, lung infections caused by bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas are much more common in people who have CF than in those who don't. An infection caused by these bacteria may be a sign of CF. People who have CF have frequent bouts of sinusitis (si-nu-SI-tis), an infection of the sinuses. The sinuses are hollow air spaces around the eyes, nose, and forehead. Frequent bouts of bronchitis (bron-KI-tis) and pneumonia (nu-MO-ne-ah) also can occur. These infections can cause long-term lung damage. As CF gets worse, you may have more serious problems, such as pneumothorax (noo-mo-THOR-aks) or bronchiectasis (brong-ke-EK-ta-sis). Some people who have CF also develop nasal polyps (growths in the nose) that may require surgery. Digestive System Signs and Symptoms In CF, mucus can block tubes, or ducts, in your pancreas (an organ in your abdomen). These blockages prevent enzymes from reaching your intestines. As a result, your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. This can cause ongoing diarrhea or bulky, foul-smelling, greasy stools. Intestinal blockages also may occur, especially in newborns. Too much gas or severe constipation in the intestines may cause stomach pain and discomfort. A hallmark of CF in children is poor weight gain and growth. These children are unable to get enough nutrients from their food because of the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins. As CF gets worse, other problems may occur, such as: Pancreatitis (PAN-kre-ah-TI-tis). This is a condition in which the pancreas become inflamed, which causes pain. Rectal prolapse. Frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside you to move out of your rectum. Liver disease due to inflamed or blocked bile ducts. Diabetes. Gallstones. Reproductive System Signs and Symptoms Men who have CF are infertile because they're born without a vas deferens. The vas deferens is a tube that delivers sperm from the testes to the penis. Women who have CF may have a hard time getting pregnant because of mucus blocking the cervix or other CF complications. Other Signs, Symptoms, and Complications Other signs and symptoms of CF are related to an upset of the balance of minerals in your blood. CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. This can cause dehydration (a lack of fluid in your body), increased heart rate, fatigue (tiredness), weakness, decreased blood pressure, heat stroke, and, rarely, death. CF also can cause clubbing and low bone density. Clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of your fingers and toes. This sign develops late in CF because your lungs aren't moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream. Low bone density also tends to occur late in CF. It can lead to bone-thinning disorders called osteoporosis and osteopenia. Doctors diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF) based on the results from various tests. Newborn Screening All States screen newborns for CF using a genetic test or a blood test. The genetic test shows whether a newborn has faulty CFTR genes. The blood test shows whether a newborn's pancreas is working properly. Sweat Test If a genetic test or blood test suggests CF, a doctor will confirm the diagnosis using a sweat test. This test is the most useful test for diagnosing CF. A sweat test measures the amount of salt in sweat. For this test, the doctor triggers sweating on a small patch of skin on an arm or leg. He or she rubs the skin with a sweat-producing chemical and then uses an electrode to provide a mild electrical current. This may cause a tingling or warm feeling. Sweat is collected on a pad or paper and then analyzed. The sweat test usually is done twice. High salt levels confirm a diagnosis of CF. Other Tests If you or your child has CF, your doctor may recommend other tests, such as: Genetic tests to find out what type of CFTR defect is causing your CF. A chest x ray. This test creates pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can show whether your lungs are inflamed or scarred, or whether they trap air. A sinus x ray. This test may show signs of sinusitis, a complication of CF. Lung function tests. These tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. A sputum culture. For this test, your doctor will take a sample of your sputum (spit) to see whether bacteria are growing in it. If you have bacteria called mucoid Pseudomonas, you may have more advanced CF that needs aggressive treatment. Prenatal Screening If you're pregnant, prenatal genetic tests can show whether your fetus has CF. These tests include amniocentesis (AM-ne-o-sen-TE-sis) and chorionic villus (ko-re-ON-ik VIL-us) sampling (CVS). In amniocentesis, your doctor inserts a hollow needle through your abdominal wall into your uterus. He or she removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby. The fluid is tested to see whether both of the baby's CFTR genes are normal. In CVS, your doctor threads a thin tube through the vagina and cervix to the placenta. The doctor removes a tissue sample from the placenta using gentle suction. The sample is tested to see whether the baby has CF. Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Testing People who have one normal CFTR gene and one faulty CFTR gene are CF carriers. CF carriers usually have no symptoms of CF and live normal lives. However, carriers can pass faulty CFTR genes on to their children. If you have a family history of CF or a partner who has CF (or a family history of it) and you're planning a pregnancy, you may want to find out whether you're a CF carrier. A genetics counselor can test a blood or saliva sample to find out whether you have a faulty CF gene. This type of testing can detect faulty CF genes in 9 out of 10 cases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) has no cure. However, treatments have greatly improved in recent years. The goals of CF treatment include: Preventing and controlling lung infections Loosening and removing thick, sticky mucus from the lungs Preventing or treating blockages in the intestines Providing enough nutrition Preventing dehydration (a lack of fluid in the body) Depending on the severity of CF, you or your child may be treated in a hospital. Specialists Involved If you or your child has CF, you may be treated by a CF specialist. This is a doctor who is familiar with the complex nature of CF. Often, a CF specialist works with a medical team of nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, and social workers. CF specialists often are located at major medical centers. The United States also has more than 100 CF Care Centers. These centers have teams of doctors, nurses, dietitians, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, and social workers who have special training related to CF care. Most CF Care Centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics. For more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page. Treatment for Lung Problems The main treatments for lung problems in people who have CF are chest physical therapy (CPT), exercise, and medicines. Your doctor also may recommend a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program. Chest Physical Therapy CPT also is called chest clapping or percussion. It involves pounding your chest and back over and over with your hands or a device to loosen the mucus from your lungs so that you can cough it up. You might sit down or lie on your stomach with your head down while you do CPT. Gravity and force help drain the mucus from your lungs. Some people find CPT hard or uncomfortable to do. Several devices have been developed that may help with CPT, such as: An electric chest clapper, known as a mechanical percussor. An inflatable therapy vest that uses high-frequency airwaves to force the mucus that's deep in your lungs toward your upper airways so you can cough it up. A small, handheld device that you exhale through. The device causes vibrations that dislodge the mucus. A mask that creates vibrations that help break the mucus loose from your airway walls. Breathing techniques also may help dislodge mucus so you can cough it up. These techniques include forcing out a couple of short breaths or deeper breaths and then doing relaxed breathing. This may help loosen the mucus in your lungs and open your airways. Exercise Aerobic exercise that makes you breathe harder can help loosen the mucus in your airways so you can cough it up. Exercise also helps improve your overall physical condition. However, CF causes your sweat to become very salty. As a result, your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. Thus, your doctor may recommend a high-salt diet or salt supplements to maintain the balance of minerals in your blood. If you exercise regularly, you may be able to cut back on your CPT. However, you should check with your doctor first. Medicines If you have CF, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, bronchodilators, or medicines to help clear the mucus. These medicines help treat or prevent lung infections, reduce swelling and open up the airways, and thin mucus. If you have mutations in a gene called G551D, which occurs in about 5 percent of people who have CF, your doctor may prescribe the oral medicine ivacaftor (approved for people with CF who are 6 years of age and older). Antibiotics are the main treatment to prevent or treat lung infections. Your doctor may prescribe oral, inhaled, or intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Oral antibiotics often are used to treat mild lung infections. Inhaled antibiotics may be used to prevent or control infections caused by the bacteria mucoid Pseudomonas. For severe or hard-to-treat infections, you may be given antibiotics through an IV tube (a tube inserted into a vein). This type of treatment may require you to stay in a hospital. Anti-inflammatory medicines can help reduce swelling in your airways due to ongoing infections. These medicines may be inhaled or oral. Bronchodilators help open the airways by relaxing the muscles around them. These medicines are inhaled. They're often taken just before CPT to help clear mucus out of your airways. You also may take bronchodilators before inhaling other medicines into your lungs. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to reduce the stickiness of your mucus and loosen it up. These medicines can help clear out mucus, improve lung function, and prevent worsening lung symptoms. Treatments for Advanced Lung Disease If you have advanced lung disease, you may need oxygen therapy. Oxygen usually is given through nasal prongs or a mask. If other treatments haven't worked, a lung transplant may be an option if you have severe lung disease. A lung transplant is surgery to remove a person's diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from a deceased donor. Pulmonary Rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend PR as part of your treatment plan. PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. PR doesn't replace medical therapy. Instead, it's used with medical therapy and may include: Exercise training Nutritional counseling Education on your lung disease or condition and how to manage it Energy-conserving techniques Breathing strategies Psychological counseling and/or group support PR has many benefits. It can improve your ability to function and your quality of life. The program also may help relieve your breathing problems. Even if you have advanced lung disease, you can still benefit from PR. For more information, go to the Health Topics Pulmonary Rehabilitation article. Treatment for Digestive Problems CF can cause many digestive problems, such as bulky stools, intestinal gas, a swollen belly, severe constipation, and pain or discomfort. Digestive problems also can lead to poor growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy can improve your strength and ability to stay active. It also can improve growth and development in children. Nutritional therapy also may make you strong enough to resist some lung infections. A nutritionist can help you create a nutritional plan that meets your needs. In addition to having a well-balanced diet that's rich in calories, fat, and protein, your nutritional therapy may include: Oral pancreatic enzymes to help you digest fats and proteins and absorb more vitamins. Supplements of vitamins A, D, E, and K to replace the fat-soluble vitamins that your intestines can't absorb. High-calorie shakes to provide you with extra nutrients. A high-salt diet or salt supplements that you take before exercising. A feeding tube to give you more calories at night while you're sleeping. The tube may be threaded through your nose and throat and into your stomach. Or, the tube may be placed directly into your stomach through a surgically made hole. Before you go to bed each night, you'll attach a bag with a nutritional solution to the entrance of the tube. It will feed you while you sleep. Other treatments for digestive problems may include enemas and mucus-thinning medicines to treat intestinal blockages. Sometimes surgery is needed to remove an intestinal blockage. Your doctor also may prescribe medicines to reduce your stomach acid and help oral pancreatic enzymes work better. Treatments for Cystic Fibrosis Complications A common complication of CF is diabetes. The type of diabetes associated with CF often requires different treatment than other types of diabetes. Another common CF complication is the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis. Your doctor may prescribe medicines that prevent your bones from losing their density. If you or your child has cystic fibrosis (CF), you should learn as much as you can about the disease. Work closely with your doctors to learn how to manage CF. Ongoing Care Having ongoing medical care by a team of doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists who specialize in CF is important. These specialists often are located at major medical centers or CF Care Centers. The United States has more than 100 CF Care Centers. Most of these centers have pediatric and adult programs or clinics. For more information about CF Care Centers, go to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Care Center Network Web page. It's standard to have CF checkups every 3 months. Talk with your doctor about whether you should get an annual flu shot and other vaccines. Take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes. In between checkups, be sure to contact your doctor if you have: Blood in your mucus, increased amounts of mucus, or a change in the color or consistency of your mucus. Decreased energy or appetite. Severe constipation or diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, or vomit that's dark green. A fever, which is a sign of infection. (However, you may still have a serious infection that needs treatment even if you don't have a fever.) Transition of Care Better treatments for CF allow people who have the disease to live longer now than in the past. Thus, the move from pediatric care to adult care is an important step in treatment. If your child has CF, encourage him or her to learn about the disease and take an active role in treatment. This will help prepare your child for the transition to adult care. CF Care Centers can help provide age-appropriate treatment throughout the transition period and into adulthood. They also will support the transition to adult care by balancing medical needs with other developmental factors, such as increased independence, relationships, and employment. Talk with your child's health care team for more information about how to help your child move from pediatric care to adult care. Lifestyle Changes In between medical checkups, you can practice good self-care and follow a healthy lifestyle. For example, follow a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Talk with your doctor about what types and amounts of foods you should include in your diet. Other lifestyle changes include: Not smoking and avoiding tobacco smoke Washing your hands often to lower your risk of infection Exercising regularly and drinking lots of fluids Doing chest physical therapy (as your doctor recommends) Other Concerns Although CF requires daily care, most people who have the disease are able to attend school and work. Adults who have CF can expect to have normal sex lives. Most men who have the disease are infertile (unable to have children). However, modern fertility treatments may help them. Women who have CF may find it hard to get pregnant, but they usually can have children. If you have CF, you should talk with your doctor if you're planning a pregnancy. Although CF can cause fertility problems, men and women who have the disease should still have protected sex to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. Emotional Issues Living with CF may cause fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Talk about how you feel with your health care team. Talking to a professional counselor also can help. If you're very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Joining a patient support group may help you adjust to living with CF. You can see how other people who have the same symptoms have coped with them. Talk with your doctor about local support groups or check with an area medical center. Support from family and friends also can help relieve stress and anxiety. Let your loved ones know how you feel and what they can do to help you."

        "query": "how common is cystic fibrosis",
        "document": "Cystic fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body. Cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive juices. These secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery. But in people with cystic fibrosis, a defective gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick. Instead of acting as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts and passageways, especially in the lungs and pancreas. Although cystic fibrosis requires daily care, people with the condition are usually able to attend school and work, and often have a better quality of life than people with cystic fibrosis had in previous decades. Improvements in screening and treatments mean people with cystic fibrosis now may live into their mid- to late 30s, on average, and some are living into their 40s and 50s. Cystic fibrosis care at Mayo Clinic Screening of newborns for cystic fibrosis is now performed in every state in the United States. As a result, the condition can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. For people born before newborn screening was performed, it's important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis signs and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or improve as time passes. Some people may not experience symptoms until adolescence or adulthood. People with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis affect the respiratory system and digestive system. However, adults diagnosed with cystic fibrosis are more likely to have atypical symptoms, such as recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), infertility and recurring pneumonia. The thick and sticky mucus associated with cystic fibrosis clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. This can cause signs and symptoms such as: - A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum)   - Wheezing   - Breathlessness   - Exercise intolerance   - Repeated lung infections   - Inflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose The thick mucus can also block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your small intestine. Without these digestive enzymes, your intestines aren't able to completely absorb the nutrients in the food you eat. The result is often: - Foul-smelling, greasy stools   - Poor weight gain and growth   - Intestinal blockage, particularly in newborns (meconium ileus)   - Severe constipation Frequent straining while passing stool can cause part of the rectum - the end of the large intestine - to protrude outside the anus (rectal prolapse). When this occurs in children, it may be a sign of cystic fibrosis. Parents should consult a physician knowledgeable about cystic fibrosis. Rectal prolapse in children may sometimes require surgery. Rectal prolapse in children with cystic fibrosis is less common than it was in the past, which may be due to earlier testing, diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis. If you or your child has symptoms of cystic fibrosis - or if someone in your family has cystic fibrosis - talk with your doctor about testing for the disease. Seek immediate medical care if you or your child has difficulty breathing. In cystic fibrosis, a defect (mutation) in a gene changes a protein that regulates the movement of salt in and out of cells. The result is thick, sticky mucus in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as increased salt in sweat. Many different defects can occur in the gene. The type of gene mutation is associated with the severity of the condition. Children need to inherit one copy of the gene from each parent in order to have the disease. If children inherit only one copy, they won't develop cystic fibrosis. However, they will be carriers and possibly pass the gene to their own children. - Family history. Because cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder, it runs in families.   - Race. Although cystic fibrosis occurs in all races, it is most common in white people of Northern European ancestry. - Damaged airways (bronchiectasis). Cystic fibrosis is one of the leading causes of bronchiectasis, a condition that damages the airways. This makes it harder to move air in and out of the lungs and clear mucus from the airways (bronchial tubes).   - Chronic infections. Thick mucus in the lungs and sinuses provides an ideal breeding ground for bacteria and fungi. People with cystic fibrosis may often have sinus infections, bronchitis or pneumonia.   - Growths in the nose (nasal polyps). Because the lining inside the nose is inflamed and swollen, it can develop soft, fleshy growths (polyps).   - Coughing up blood (hemoptysis). Over time, cystic fibrosis can cause thinning of the airway walls. As a result, teenagers and adults with cystic fibrosis may cough up blood.   - Pneumothorax. This condition, in which air collects in the space that separates the lungs from the chest wall, also is more common in older people with cystic fibrosis. Pneumothorax can cause chest pain and breathlessness.   - Respiratory failure. Over time, cystic fibrosis can damage lung tissue so badly that it no longer works. Lung function usually worsens gradually, and it eventually can become life-threatening.   - Acute exacerbations. People with cystic fibrosis may experience worsening of their respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath, for several days to weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation and requires treatment in the hospital. - Nutritional deficiencies. Thick mucus can block the tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your intestines. Without these enzymes, your body can't absorb protein, fats or fat-soluble vitamins.   - Diabetes. The pancreas produces insulin, which your body needs to use sugar. Cystic fibrosis increases the risk of diabetes. Around 30 percent of people with cystic fibrosis develop diabetes by age 30.   - Blocked bile duct. The tube that carries bile from your liver and gallbladder to your small intestine may become blocked and inflamed, leading to liver problems and sometimes gallstones.   - Intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction can happen to people with cystic fibrosis at all ages. Children and adults with cystic fibrosis are more likely than are infants to develop intussusception, a condition in which a section of the intestines folds in on itself like an accordion.   - Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). DIOS is partial or complete obstruction where the small intestine meets the large intestine. Almost all men with cystic fibrosis are infertile because the tube that connects the testes and prostate gland (vas deferens) is either blocked with mucus or missing entirely. Certain fertility treatments and surgical procedures sometimes make it possible for men with cystic fibrosis to become biological fathers. Although women with cystic fibrosis may be less fertile than other women, it's possible for them to conceive and to have successful pregnancies. Still, pregnancy can worsen the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis, so be sure to discuss the possible risks with your doctor. - Thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). People with cystic fibrosis are at higher risk of developing a dangerous thinning of bones.   - Electrolyte imbalances and dehydration. Because people with cystic fibrosis have saltier sweat, the balance of minerals in their blood may be upset. Signs and symptoms include increased heart rate, fatigue, weakness and low blood pressure. To diagnose cystic fibrosis, doctors may conduct several tests. Newborn screening and diagnosis Every state in the U.S. now routinely screens newborns for cystic fibrosis. Early diagnosis means treatment can begin immediately. In one screening test, a blood sample is checked for higher than normal levels of a chemical (immunoreactive trypsinogen, or IRT) released by the pancreas. A newborn's IRT levels may be high because of premature birth or a stressful delivery. For that reason other tests may be needed to confirm a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Genetic tests may be used in addition to checking the IRT levels to confirm the diagnosis. Doctors may also conduct genetic tests to test for specific defects on the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. To evaluate if an infant has cystic fibrosis, doctors may also conduct a sweat test when the infant is at least 2 weeks old. In a sweat test, doctors apply a sweat-producing chemical to a small area of skin. They then collect the sweat to test it and see if it's saltier than normal. Testing may be done at a center specializing in cystic fibrosis. Testing of older children and adults Cystic fibrosis tests may be recommended for older children and adults who weren't screened at birth. Your doctor may suggest genetic and sweat tests for cystic fibrosis if you have recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), nasal polyps, chronic sinus or lung infections, bronchiectasis, or male infertility. There is no cure for cystic fibrosis, but treatment can ease symptoms and reduce complications. Close monitoring and early, aggressive intervention is recommended. Managing cystic fibrosis is complex, so consider obtaining treatment at a center staffed by doctors and other staff trained in cystic fibrosis. Doctors may work with a multidisciplinary team of doctors and medical professionals trained in cystic fibrosis to evaluate and treat your condition. The goals of treatment include: - Preventing and controlling infections that occur in the lungs - Removing and loosening mucus from the lungs - Treating and preventing intestinal blockage - Providing adequate nutrition Medications The options may include: - Antibiotics to treat and prevent lung infections - Anti-inflammatory medications to lessen swelling in the airways in your lungs - Mucus-thinning drugs to help you cough up the mucus, which can improve lung function - Inhaled medications called bronchodilators that can help keep your airways open by relaxing the muscles around your bronchial tubes - Oral pancreatic enzymes to help your digestive tract absorb nutrients For those with cystic fibrosis who have certain gene mutations, doctors may recommend a newer medication called ivacaftor (Kalydeco). This medication may improve lung function and weight, and reduce the amount of salt in sweat. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for people with cystic fibrosis who are age 6 and older. The dose depends on your weight and age. Doctors may conduct liver function tests and eye examinations before prescribing ivacaftor and on a regular basis while you're taking it to check for side effects such as liver function abnormalities and cataracts. For people with a certain gene mutation who are age 12 and older, another drug (Orkambi) is available that combines ivacaftor with a medication called lumacaftor. The combination of these medications may improve lung function and reduce the risk of exacerbations. However, some people may experience side effects such as chest discomfort and shortness of breath soon after starting the medication. Some people may also have high blood pressure while taking the medication. Doctors may monitor you for any side effects. Chest physical therapy Loosening the thick mucus in the lungs makes it easier to cough up. Chest physical therapy helps loosen mucus. It is usually done from one to four times a day. A common technique is clapping with cupped hands on the front and back of the chest. Certain breathing techniques also may be used to help loosen the mucus. Your doctor will instruct you about the type of chest physical therapy he or she recommends for you. Mechanical devices also can help loosen lung mucus. These include a vibrating vest or a tube or mask you breathe into. Pulmonary rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend a long-term program that may improve your lung function and overall well-being. Pulmonary rehabilitation is usually done on an outpatient basis and may include: - Physical exercise that may improve your condition - Breathing techniques that may help loosen mucus and improve breathing - Nutritional counseling - Counseling and support - Education about your condition Surgical and other procedures - Nasal polyp removal. Your doctor may recommend surgery to remove nasal polyps that obstruct breathing. - Oxygen therapy. If your blood oxygen level declines, your doctor may recommend that you breathe pure oxygen to prevent high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). - Endoscopy and lavage. Mucus may be suctioned from obstructed airways through an endoscope. - Feeding tube. Cystic fibrosis interferes with digestion, so you can't absorb nutrients from food very well. Your doctor may suggest temporarily using a feeding tube to deliver extra nutrition while you sleep. This tube may be inserted in your nose and guided to your stomach, or it may be surgically implanted into the abdomen. - Bowel surgery. If a blockage develops in your bowel, you may need surgery to remove it. Intussusception, where a section of bowel has folded in on itself, also may require surgical repair. - Lung transplant. If you have severe breathing problems, life-threatening lung complications or increasing resistance to antibiotics used to treat lung infections, lung transplantation may be an option. Because bacteria line the airways in diseases that cause permanent widening of the large airways (bronchiectasis), such as cystic fibrosis, both lungs need to be replaced. Cystic fibrosis does not recur in transplanted lungs. However, other complications associated with cystic fibrosis - such as sinus infections, diabetes, pancreas problems and osteoporosis - can still occur after a lung transplant. You can manage your condition and minimize complications in several ways. Always talk to your doctor before starting home remedies. Cystic fibrosis can cause malnourishment because the enzymes needed for digestion can't reach your small intestine, preventing food from being absorbed. People with cystic fibrosis may need a significantly higher number of calories daily than do people without the condition. A healthy diet is important to maintain good lung function. It's also important to drink lots of fluids, which can help thin the mucus in your lungs. You may work with a dietitian to develop a nutrition plan. Most people with cystic fibrosis need to take pancreatic enzyme capsules with every meal and snack. In addition, your doctor may recommend: - Antacids - Supplemental high-calorie nutrition - Special fat-soluble vitamins - Extra fiber to prevent intestinal blockage - Extra salt, especially during hot weather or before exercising - Adequate water during hot weather In addition to other usual childhood vaccines, people with cystic fibrosis should have the annual flu vaccine and any other vaccines their doctor recommends. Cystic fibrosis doesn't affect the immune system, but children with cystic fibrosis are more likely to develop complications when they become sick. Regular exercise helps loosen mucus in your airways, and strengthens your heart. For many people with cystic fibrosis, participating in sports can improve confidence and self-esteem. Anything that gets you moving, including walking and biking, can help. Don't smoke in your home or car, and don't allow other people to smoke around you or your child. Secondhand smoke is harmful for everyone, but especially for people with cystic fibrosis. Teach all the members of your family to wash their hands thoroughly before eating, after using the bathroom, when coming home from work or school, and after being around a person who is sick. Hand-washing is the best way to protect against infection. You'll have ongoing care from your doctor and other medical professionals. Make sure to attend your regular follow-up appointments. Take your medications as prescribed and follow therapies as instructed. Contact your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms such as severe constipation, more mucus than usual, blood in your mucus or reduced energy."

        "query": "how common is cystic fibrosis",
        "document": "Cystic fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis is a disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other areas of the body. It is one of the most common chronic lung diseases in children and young adults. It is a life-threatening disorder. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that is passed down through families. It is caused by a defective gene that makes the body produce abnormally thick and sticky fluid, called mucus. This mucus builds up in the breathing passages of the lungs and in the pancreas.   The buildup of mucus results in life-threatening lung infections and serious digestion problems. The disease may also affect the sweat glands and a man's reproductive system.   Many people carry a CF gene, but do not have symptoms. This is because a person with CF must inherit 2 defective genes, 1 from each parent. Some white Americans have the CF gene. It is more common among those of northern or central European descent.   Most children with CF are diagnosed by age 2. For a small number, the disease is not detected until age 18 or older. These children often have a milder form of the disease. Symptoms in newborns may include:     - Delayed growth   - Failure to gain weight normally during childhood    - No bowel movements in first 24 to 48 hours of life    - Salty-tasting skin      Symptoms related to bowel function may include:     - Belly pain from severe constipation    - Increased gas, bloating, or a belly that appears swollen (distended)    - Nausea and loss of appetite    - Stools that are pale or clay-colored, foul smelling, have mucus, or that float    - Weight loss      Symptoms related to the lungs and sinuses may include:     - Coughing or increased mucus in the sinuses or lungs   - Fatigue   - Nasal congestion caused by nasal polyps   - Repeated episodes of pneumonia (symptoms of pneumonia in someone with cystic fibrosis include fever, increased coughing and shortness of breath, increased mucus, and loss of appetite)   - Sinus pain or pressure caused by infection or polyps     Symptoms that may be noticed later in life:     - Infertility (in men)   - Repeated inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)   - Respiratory symptoms   - Clubbed fingers A blood test is done to help detect CF. The test looks for changes in the CF gene. Other tests used to diagnose CF include:     -  Immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) test is a standard newborn screening test for CF. A high level of IRT suggests possible CF and requires further testing.    - Sweat chloride test is the standard diagnostic test for CF. A high salt level in the person's sweat is a sign of the disease.      Other tests that identify problems that can be related to CF include:     - Chest x-ray or CT scan   - Fecal fat test   - Lung function tests   - Measurement of pancreatic function   - Secretin stimulation test   - Trypsin and chymotrypsin in stool   - Upper GI and small bowel series An early diagnosis of CF and treatment plan can improve both survival and quality of life. Follow-up and monitoring are very important. When possible, care should be received at a cystic fibrosis specialty clinic. When children reach adulthood, they should transfer to a cystic fibrosis specialty center for adults.   Treatment for lung problems includes:     - Antibiotics to prevent and treat lung and sinus infections. They may be taken by mouth, or given in the veins or by breathing treatments. People with CF may take antibiotics only when needed, or all the time. Doses are often higher than normal.   - Inhaled medicines to help open the airways.   - Other medicines that are given by a breathing treatment to thin mucus and make it easier to cough up are DNAse enzyme. therapy and highly concentrated salt solutions (hypertonic saline).   - Flu vaccine and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) yearly (ask your health care provider).   - Lung transplant is an option in some cases.   - Oxygen therapy may be needed as lung disease gets worse.     Lung problems are also treated with therapies to thin the mucus. This makes it easier to cough the mucus out of the lungs.    These methods include:     - Activity or exercise that causes you to breathe deeply   - Devices that are used during the day to help clear the airways of too much mucus   - Manual chest percussion (or chest physiotherapy), in which a family member or a therapist lightly claps the person's chest, back, and area under the arms     Treatment for bowel and nutritional problems may include:     - A special diet high in protein and calories for older children and adults   - Pancreatic enzymes to help absorb fats and protein, which are taken with every meal   - Vitamin supplements, especially vitamins A, D, E, and K   - Your provider can advise other treatments if you have very hard stools      Ivacaftor is a medicine that treats certain types of CF. It improves the function of one of the defective genes that causes CF. As a result, there is less buildup of thick mucus in the lungs. Other CF symptoms are improved as well.   Care and monitoring at home should include:      - Avoiding smoke, dust, dirt, fumes, household chemicals, fireplace smoke, and mold or mildew.   - Giving plenty of fluids, especially to infants and children in hot weather, when there is diarrhea or loose stools, or during extra physical activity.   - Exercising 2 or 3 times each week. Swimming, jogging, and cycling are good options.   - Clearing or bringing up mucus or secretions from the airways. This must be done 1 to 4 times each day. Patients, families, and caregivers must learn about doing chest percussion and postural drainage to help keep the airways clear. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cystic fibrosis support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help your family to not feel alone. Most children with CF stay in good health until they reach adulthood. They are able to take part in most activities and attend school. Many young adults with CF finish college or find jobs.   Lung disease eventually worsens to the point where the person is disabled. Today, the average life span for people with CF who live to adulthood is about 37 years.    Death is most often caused by lung complications. The most common complication is chronic respiratory infection.   Other complications include:     - Bowel problems, such as gallstones, intestinal blockage, and rectal prolapse   - Coughing up blood   - Chronic respiratory failure   - Diabetes    - Infertility   - Liver disease or liver failure, pancreatitis, biliary cirrhosis   - Malnutrition   - Nasal polyps and sinusitis   - Osteoporosis and arthritis   - Pneumonia that keeps coming back   - Pneumothorax   - Right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale) Call your provider if an infant or child has symptoms of CF, and experiences:     - Fever, increased coughing, changes in sputum or blood in sputum, loss of appetite, or other signs of pneumonia   - Increased weight loss   - More frequent bowel movements or stools that are foul-smelling or have more mucus   - Swollen belly or increased bloating     Call your provider if a person with CF develops new symptoms or if symptoms get worse, particularly severe breathing difficulty or coughing up blood. CF cannot be prevented. Screening those with a family history of the disease may detect the CF gene in many carriers. Updated by: Neil K.

        "query": "how common is fragile x syndrome",
        "document": "Fragile X Syndrome: The genetic disorder Fragile X syndrome, which results from mutations in a gene on the X chromosome, is the most commonly inherited form of developmental and intellectual disability. The NICHD supports and conducts research on the diagnosis, treatment, management, prevention, and inheritance of Fragile X and its associated conditions, Fragile X-Associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI) and Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). All three conditions result from changes in the same gene on the X chromosome.\u00a0 What is Fragile X syndrome? Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects a person\u2019s development, especially that person\u2019s behavior and ability to learn. In addition, Fragile X can affect: - Communication skills - Physical appearance - Sensitivity to noise, light, or other sensory information Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) People with Fragile X syndrome may not have noticeable symptoms, or they can have more serious symptoms that range from learning disabilities to cognitive and behavior problems. How is FMR1 mutation related? \u00bb Fragile X syndrome and its associated conditions are caused by changes (mutations) in the FMR1 gene found on the X chromosome. This mutation affects how the body makes the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP. The mutation causes the body to make only a little bit or none of the protein, which can cause the symptoms of Fragile X. In a gene, the information for making a protein has two parts: the introduction, and the instructions for making the protein itself. Researchers call the introduction the promoter because of how it helps to start the process of building the protein. The promoter part of the FMR1 gene includes many repeats\u2014repeated instances of a specific DNA sequence called the CGG sequence. A normal FMR1 gene has between 6 and 40 repeats in the promoter; the average is 30 repeats. People with between 55 and 200 repeats have a premutation of the gene. The premutation may cause the gene to not work properly, but it does not cause intellectual and developmental disability (IDD). The premutation is linked to the disorders FXPOI and FXTAS. However, not all people with the premutation show symptoms of FXPOI or FXTAS. People with 200 or more repeats in the promoter part of the gene have a full mutation, meaning the gene might not work at all. People with a full mutation often have Fragile X syndrome. The number of repeats, also called the \u201csize of the mutation,\u201d affects the type of symptoms and how serious the symptoms of Fragile X syndrome will be. Inheriting Fragile X Syndrome Fragile X syndrome is inherited, which means it is passed down from parents to children. Anyone with the FMR1 gene mutation can pass it to their children. However, a person who inherits the gene mutation may not develop Fragile X syndrome. Males will pass it down to all of their daughters and not their sons. Females have a 50/50 chance to pass it along to both their sons and daughters. In some cases, an FMR1 premutation can change to a full mutation when it is passed from parent to child. Read more about how FMR1 changes as it is passed from parent to child. \u00ab\u00a0 Condition Information What causes it?\u00a0\u00bb Fragile X results from a change or mutation in the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, which is found on the X chromosome. The gene normally makes a protein called Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP. This protein is important for creating and maintaining connections between cells in the brain and nervous system. The mutation causes the body to make only a little bit or none of the protein, which often causes the symptoms of Fragile X. Not everyone with the mutated FMR1 gene has symptoms of Fragile X syndrome, because the body may still be able to make FMRP. A few things affect how much FMRP the body can make: - The size of the mutation. Some people have a smaller mutation (a lower number of repeats) in their FMR1 gene, while others have big mutations (a large number of repeats) in the gene. If the mutation is small, the body may be able to make some of the protein. Having the protein available makes the symptoms milder. - The number of cells that have the mutation. Because not every cell in the body is exactly the same, some cells might have the FMR1 mutation while others do not. This situation is called mosaicism (pronounced moh-ZAY-uh-siz-uhm). If the mutation is in most of the body\u2019s cells, the person will probably have symptoms of Fragile X syndrome. If the mutation is in only some of the cells, the person might not have any symptoms at all or only mild symptoms. - Being female. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have only one. In females, if the FMR1 gene on one X chromosome has the mutation, the FMR1 gene on the other X chromosome might not have the mutation. Even if one of the female\u2019s genes has a very large mutation, the body can usually make at least some FMRP, leading to milder symptoms. \u00ab\u00a0 How is FMR1 mutation related? How many people are affected?\u00a0\u00bb About 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 8,000 females have Fragile X syndrome. How many people have the Fragile X premutation? Although Fragile X syndrome is relatively rare, premutations in the FMR1 gene are relatively common: A recent study of 6,747 people found that 1 in 151 women and 1 in 468 men had the premutation. People with the premutation might not have any symptoms of Fragile X. However, the premutation can sometimes expand in the next generation, which can cause Fragile X syndrome. \u00ab\u00a0 What causes it? What are common symptoms\u00a0\u00bb People with Fragile X do not all have the same signs and symptoms, but they do have some things in common. Symptoms are often milder in females than in males. - Intelligence and learning. Many people with Fragile X have problems with intellectual functioning. - These problems can range from the mild, such as learning disorders or problems with mathematics, to the severe, such as an intellectual or developmental disability. - The syndrome may affect the ability to think, reason, and learn. - Because many people with Fragile X also have attention disorders, hyperactivity, anxiety, and language-processing problems, a person with Fragile X may have more capabilities than his or her IQ (intelligence quotient) score suggests. - Physical. Most infants and younger children with Fragile X don\u2019t have any specific physical features of this syndrome. When these children start to go through puberty, however, many will begin to develop certain features that are typical of those with Fragile X. - These features include a narrow face, large head, large ears, flexible joints, flat feet, and a prominent forehead. - These physical signs become more obvious with age. - Behavioral, social, and emotional. Most children with Fragile X have some behavioral challenges. - They may be afraid or anxious in new situations. - They may have trouble making eye contact with other people. - Boys, especially, may have trouble paying attention or be aggressive. - Girls may be shy around new people. They may also have attention disorders and problems with hyperactivity. - Speech and language. Most boys with Fragile X have some problems with speech and language. - They may have trouble speaking clearly, may stutter, or may leave out parts of words. They may also have problems understanding other people\u2019s social cues, such as tone of voice or specific types of body language. - Girls usually do not have severe problems with speech or language. - Some children with Fragile X begin talking later than typically developing children. Most will talk eventually, but a few might stay nonverbal throughout their lives. - Sensory. Many children with Fragile X are bothered by certain sensations, such as bright light, loud noises, or the way certain clothing feels on their bodies. - These sensory issues might cause them to act out or display behavior problems. \u00ab\u00a0 How many people are affected? How is it diagnosed?\u00a0\u00bb Health care providers often use a blood sample to diagnose Fragile X. The health care provider will take a sample of blood and will send it to a laboratory, which will determine what form of the FMR1 gene is present. Prenatal Testing (During Pregnancy) Pregnant women who have an FMR1 premutation or full mutation may pass that mutated gene on to their children. A prenatal test allows health care providers to detect the mutated gene in the developing fetus. This important information helps families and providers to prepare for Fragile X syndrome and to intervene as early as possible. Possible types of prenatal tests include: - Amniocentesis (pronounced am-nee-oh-sen-TEE-sis). A health care provider takes a sample of amniotic (pronounced am-nee-OT-ik) fluid, which is then tested for the FMR1 mutation. - Chorionic villus (pronounced KOHR-ee-on-ik VILL-uhs) sampling. A health care provider takes a sample of cells from the placenta, which is then tested for the FMR1 mutation. Because prenatal testing involves some risk to the mother and fetus, if you or a family member is considering prenatal testing for Fragile X, discuss all the risks and benefits with your health care provider. Prenatal testing is not very common, and many parents do not know they carry the mutation. Therefore, parents usually start to notice symptoms in their children when they are infants or toddlers. The average age at diagnosis is 36 months for boys and 42 months for girls. Diagnosis of Children Many parents first notice symptoms of delayed development in their infants or toddlers. These symptoms may include delays in speech and language skills, social and emotional difficulties, and being sensitive to certain sensations. Children may also be delayed in or have problems with motor skills such as learning to walk. A health care provider can perform developmental screening to determine the nature of delays in a child. If a health care provider suspects the child has Fragile X syndrome, he/she can refer parents to a clinical geneticist, who can perform a genetic test for Fragile X syndrome. \u00ab\u00a0 What are common symptoms? What are the treatments?\u00a0\u00bb \u200b\u200b There is no single treatment for Fragile X syndrome, but there are treatments that help minimize the symptoms of the condition. Individuals with Fragile X who receive appropriate education, therapy services, and medications have the best chance of using all of their individual capabilities and skills. Even those with an intellectual or developmental disability can learn to master many self-help skills. Early intervention is important. Because a young child\u2019s brain is still forming, early intervention gives children the best start possible and the greatest chance of developing a full range of skills. The sooner a child with Fragile X syndrome gets treatment, the more opportunity there is for learning. \u00ab How is it diagnosed? Educational treatments \u00bb Are there specific disorders or conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome? How is Fragile X syndrome inherited? How does the FMR1 gene change as it is passed from parent to child? Are there specific disorders or conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome? Among the other conditions associated with Fragile X syndrome are the following: - Autism spectrum disorder. From 30% to 50% of people with Fragile X also meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder. - Mitral valve prolapse. In mitral valve prolapse (pronounced MY-truhl valv PROH-laps), a heart condition, the valve that separates the upper and lower left chambers of the heart does not work properly. This condition is usually not life-threatening, but in severe cases, surgery might be required to correct the problem. - Seizures. Between 6% and 20% of children with Fragile X syndrome have seizures. Seizures associated with the syndrome are more common in boys than in girls. [top] How is Fragile X syndrome inherited? The gene for Fragile X is carried on the X chromosome. Because both males (XY) and females (XX) have at least one X chromosome, both can pass on the mutated gene to their children. - A father with the altered gene for Fragile X on his X chromosome will pass that gene on only to his daughters. To his sons he will pass on a Y chromosome, which doesn\u2019t transmit Fragile X syndrome. Therefore, a father with the altered gene on his X chromosome and a mother with normal X chromosomes would have daughters with the altered gene for Fragile X, while none of their sons would have the mutated gene. - A father can pass on the premutation form of the FMR1 gene to his daughters but not the full mutation. Even if the father himself has a full mutation of this gene, it appears that sperm can carry only the premutation. Scientists don\u2019t understand how or why fathers can pass on only the milder form of Fragile X to their daughters. This remains an area of focused research. - Mothers pass on only X chromosomes to their children, so if a mother has the altered gene for Fragile X, she can pass that gene to either her sons or her daughters. If a mother has the mutated gene on one X chromosome and has one normal X chromosome, and the father has no mutations, all the children have a 50-50 chance of inheriting the mutated gene. - These 50-50 odds apply for each child the parents have. Having one child with the FMR1 mutation does not increase or decrease the chances of having another child with the mutated FMR1 gene. This is also true for the severity of the symptoms. Having one child with mild symptoms does not mean that the other children will have severe symptoms, and having a child with severe symptoms does not mean that the other children will have mild symptoms. [top] How does the FMR1 gene change as it is passed from parent to child? The repeats in the promoter part of the FMR1 gene are unstable, and sometimes the number of repeats increases from one generation to the next. A premutation gene is less stable than a full mutation gene. So as it passes from parent to child, a premutation gene might expand to become a full mutation gene. The chances of expansion depend on the number of repeats in the promoter of the premutation gene: Normal FMR1 genes that have 5 to 44 CGG repeats in the promoter are considered normal. When these genes are passed from parent to child, the number of repeats does not increase or decrease. Intermediate FMR1 genes with 45 to 54 CGG repeats in the promoter are considered intermediate, or borderline. An intermediate gene may expand from one generation to the next, depending on which parent has the gene. Mother to Child About 14% of the time, when a mother passes an intermediate gene to her child, the CGG repeats increase to a number seen with premutations. Research shows that an intermediate gene will not become a full mutation gene in one generation, and so a mother with an intermediate gene will not have a child with a full mutation. Father to Child When intermediate genes are transmitted from father to child, they are generally stable and do not increase to premutations. Premutations Premutation (55 to 199 CGG repeats) FMR1 genes can expand to a full mutation from one generation to the next. The risk of expansion depends on which parent has the gene and the number of repeats in that gene. Mother to Child An FMR1 gene from the mother with 100 CGG repeats is very likely to expand to a full mutation when passed to the child. An FMR1 gene from the mother with 70 to 79 CGG repeats has about a 30% chance of expanding to a full mutation in one generation. Father to Child Premutations passed from father to child have almost no chance of expanding to full mutations. [top] \u00ab What are the Treatments?"

        "document": "Dementia: Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a descriptive term for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness.\u00a0 Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimer\u2019s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington\u2019s disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\u00a0 Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia (conditions in which the brain\u2019s oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems.\u00a0 Although it is common in very elderly individuals, dementia is not a normal part of the aging process. Drugs to specifically treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease and some other progressive dementias are now available.\u00a0 Although these drugs do not halt the disease or reverse existing brain damage, they can improve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. This may improve an individual\u2019s quality of life, ease the burden on caregivers, or delay admission to a nursing home. Many researchers are also examining whether these drugs may be useful for treating other types of dementia.\u00a0 Many people with dementia, particularly those in the early stages, may benefit from practicing tasks designed to improve performance in specific aspects of cognitive functioning. For example, people can sometimes be taught to use memory aids, such as mnemonics, computerized recall devices, or note taking. There are many disorders that can cause dementia. Some, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease or Huntington\u2019s disease, lead to a progressive loss of mental functions. But other types of dementia can be halted or reversed with appropriate treatment. People with moderate or advanced dementia typically need round-the-clock care and supervision to prevent them from harming themselves or others. They also may need assistance with daily activities such as eating, bathing, and dressing."

        "document": "Dementia (WHAT IS VASCULAR DEMENTIA?): Vascular dementia, considered the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) result from injuries to the vessels supplying blood to the brain, often after a stroke or series of strokes. Vascular dementia and VCI arise as a result of risk factors that similarly increase the risk for cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke), including atrial fibrillation, hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, and high cholesterol. The symptoms of vascular dementia can be similar to those of Alzheimer's, and both conditions can occur at the same time. Symptoms of vascular dementia can begin suddenly and worsen or improve during one's lifetime.This type of dementia is often managed with drugs to prevent strokes. The aim is to reduce the risk of additional brain damage. Some studies suggest that drugs that improve memory in Alzheimer's disease might benefit people with early vascular dementia. Interventions that address risk factors may be incorporated into the management of vascular dementia.Some types of vascular dementia include:Multi-infarct dementia. This type of dementia occurs when a person has had many small strokes that damage brain cells. One side of the body may be disproportionally affected, and multi-infarct dementia may impair language or other functions, depending on the region of the brain that is affected. When the strokes occur on both sides of the brain, dementia is more likely than when stroke occurs on one side of the brain. In some cases, a single stroke can damage the brain enough to cause dementia. This so-called single-infarct dementia is more common when stroke affects the left side of the brain-where speech centers are located-and/or when it involves the hippocampus, the part of the brain that is vital for memory.Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). This inherited form of cardiovascular disease results in a thickening of the walls of small- and medium-sized blood vessels, eventually stemming the flow of blood to the brain. It is associated with mutations of a gene called Notch3. CADASIL is associated with multi-infarct dementia, stroke, migraine with aura (migraine preceded by visual symptoms), and mood disorders. The first symptoms can appear in people between ages 20 and 40. Many people with CADASIL are undiagnosed. People with first-degree relatives who have CADASIL can be tested for genetic mutations to the Notch3 gene to determine their own risk of developing CADASIL.Subcortical vascular dementia, also called Binswanger's disease. This rare form of dementia involves extensive damage to the small blood vessels and nerve fibers that make up white matter, the \"network\" part of the brain believed to be critical for relaying messages between regions. The symptoms of Binswanger's are related to the disruption of subcortical neural circuits involving short-term memory, organization, mood, attention, decision making, and appropriate behavior. A characteristic feature of this disease is psychomotor slowness, such as an increase in the time it takes for a person to think of a letter and then write it on a piece of paper.For more information about vascular dementia and VCI, see NIA's list of resources."

        "document": "Dementia (Treatment): Most types of dementia can't be cured, but there are ways to manage your symptoms. Medications The following are used to temporarily improve dementia symptoms. - Cholinesterase inhibitors. These medications - including donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (Razadyne) - work by boosting levels of a chemical messenger involved in memory and judgment. Although primarily used to treat Alzheimer's disease, these medications might also be prescribed for other dementias, including vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia and Lewy body dementia. Side effects can include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. - Memantine. Memantine (Namenda) works by regulating the activity of glutamate, another chemical messenger involved in brain functions, such as learning and memory. In some cases, memantine is prescribed with a cholinesterase inhibitor. A common side effect of memantine is dizziness. - Other medications. Your doctor might prescribe medications to treat other symptoms or conditions, such as depression, sleep disturbances or agitation. Therapies Several dementia symptoms and behavior problems might be treated initially using nondrug approaches, such as: - Occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can show you how to make your home safer and teach coping behaviors. The purpose is to prevent accidents, such as falls; manage behavior; and prepare you for the dementia progression. - Modifying the environment. Reducing clutter and noise can make it easier for someone with dementia to focus and function. You might need to hide objects that can threaten safety, such as knives and car keys. Monitoring systems can alert you if the person with dementia wanders. - Modifying tasks. Break tasks into easier steps and focus on success, not failure. Structure and routine also help reduce confusion in people with dementia."

        "query": "how do people get diabetes",
        "document": "Diabetes (Causes): Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.   To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested:     - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.   - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.        People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:     - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin   - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally   - Both of the above      There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:       - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown.   - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should.   - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2.      Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.   If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease."

        "query": "how do we treat the burns caused by radiation?",
        "document": "Burns (Treatment): Treatment of burns depends on the type and extent of the injuries. Most minor burns can be treated at home using over-the-counter products or aloe. They usually heal within a few weeks. For serious burns, after appropriate first aid care and wound assessment, your treatment may involve medications, wound dressings, therapy and surgery. The goals of treatment are to control pain, remove dead tissue, prevent infection, reduce scarring, regain function and address emotional needs. You may need months of additional treatments and therapy. This may be done during a hospital stay, on an outpatient basis or at home. Factors affecting this choice include your wishes, other conditions and abilities, such as whether you're able to change bandages. Medications and wound healing products For major burns, various medications and products are used to encourage healing. - Water-based treatments. Your care team may use techniques such as ultrasound mist therapy to clean and stimulate the wound tissue. - Fluids to prevent dehydration. You may need intravenous (IV) fluids to prevent dehydration and organ failure. - Pain and anxiety medications. Healing burns can be incredibly painful. You may need morphine and anti-anxiety medications - particularly for dressing changes. - Burn creams and ointments. Your care team can select from a variety of topical products for wound healing. These help keep the wound moist, reduce pain, prevent infection and speed healing. - Dressings. Your care team may also use various specialty wound dressings. These create a moist environment that fights infection and helps the burn heal. - Drugs that fight infection. If you develop an infection, you may need IV antibiotics. - Tetanus shot. Your doctor might recommend a tetanus shot after a burn injury. Physical and occupational therapy If the burned area is large, especially if it covers any joints, you may need physical therapy exercises. These can help stretch the skin so the joints can remain flexible. Other types of exercises can improve muscle strength and coordination. And occupational therapy may help if you have difficulty doing your normal daily activities. Surgical and other procedures You may need one or more of the following procedures: - Breathing assistance. If you've been burned on the face or neck, your throat may swell shut. If that appears likely, your doctor may insert a tube down your windpipe (trachea) to keep oxygen supplied to your lungs. - Tube feeding. Your metabolism goes into overdrive when your body starts trying to heal your burns. To provide adequate nutrition for this task, you doctor may thread a feeding tube through your nose to your stomach. - Easing blood flow around the wound. If a burn scab (eschar) goes completely around a limb, it can tighten and cut off the blood circulation. A scab (eschar) that goes completely around the chest can make it difficult to breathe. Your doctor may cut the eschar in several places to relieve this pressure. This procedure is called decompression. - Skin grafts. A skin graft is a surgical procedure in which sections of your own healthy skin are used to replace the scar tissue caused by deep burns. Donor skin from cadavers or pigs can be used as a temporary solution. - Plastic surgery. Plastic surgery (reconstruction) can improve the appearance of burn scars and increase the flexibility of joints affected by scarring."

        "document": "Lupus nephritis: Lupus nephritis is a kidney disorder which is a complication of systemic lupus erythematosus. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus) is an autoimmune disease. This means there is a problem with the body's immune system.   Normally, the immune system helps protect the body from infection or harmful substances. But in people with an autoimmune disease, the immune system cannot tell the difference between harmful substances and healthy ones. As a result, the immune system attacks otherwise healthy cells and tissues.   SLE may damage different parts of the kidney. This can lead lead to disorders such as interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and membranous glomerulonephritis. Over time, kidney failure can result. Symptoms of lupus nephritis include:     - Blood in the urine   - Foamy appearance to urine   - High blood pressure   - Swelling of any area of the body A physical exam shows signs of decreased kidney functioning with body swelling (edema). Blood pressure may be high. Abnormal sounds may be heard when the doctor listens to your heart and lungs.   Tests that may be done include:     - ANA titer   - BUN and creatinine   - Complement levels   - Urinalysis   - Urine protein   - Kidney biopsy, to determine appropriate treatment The goal of treatment is to improve kidney function and to delay kidney failure.   Medicines may include drugs that suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, or azathioprine.   You may need dialysis to control symptoms of kidney failure, sometimes for only a while. A kidney transplant may be recommended. People with active lupus should not have a transplant because the condition can occur in the transplanted kidney. How well you do, depends on the specific form of lupus nephritis. You may have flare-ups, and then times when you do not have any symptoms.    Some people with this condition develop chronic kidney failure.   Although lupus nephritis may return in a transplanted kidney, it rarely leads to end-stage kidney disease. Complications that may result from lupus nephritis include:     - Acute renal failure   - Chronic renal failure Call your health care provider if you have blood in the urine or swelling of your body.   If you have lupus nephritis, call your provider if you notice decreased urine output. Treating lupus may help prevent or delay onset of lupus nephritis.

        "document": "Lupus: Lupus is a systemic autoimmune disease that occurs when your body's immune system attacks your own tissues and organs. Inflammation caused by lupus can affect many different body systems - including your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart and lungs. Lupus can be difficult to diagnose because its signs and symptoms often mimic those of other ailments. The most distinctive sign of lupus - a facial rash that resembles the wings of a butterfly unfolding across both cheeks - occurs in many but not all cases of lupus. Some people are born with a tendency toward developing lupus, which may be triggered by infections, certain drugs or even sunlight. While there's no cure for lupus, treatments can help control symptoms. No two cases of lupus are exactly alike. Signs and symptoms may come on suddenly or develop slowly, may be mild or severe, and may be temporary or permanent. Most people with lupus have mild disease characterized by episodes - called flares - when signs and symptoms get worse for a while, then improve or even disappear completely for a time. The signs and symptoms of lupus that you experience will depend on which body systems are affected by the disease. The most common signs and symptoms include: - Fatigue   - Fever   - Joint pain, stiffness and swelling   - Butterfly-shaped rash on the face that covers the cheeks and bridge of the nose or rashes elsewhere on the body   - Skin lesions that appear or worsen with sun exposure (photosensitivity)   - Fingers and toes that turn white or blue when exposed to cold or during stressful periods (Raynaud's phenomenon)   - Shortness of breath   - Chest pain   - Dry eyes   - Headaches, confusion and memory loss When to see a doctor See your doctor if you develop an unexplained rash, ongoing fever, persistent aching or fatigue. Lupus occurs when your immune system attacks healthy tissue in your body (autoimmune disease). It's likely that lupus results from a combination of your genetics and your environment. It appears that people with an inherited predisposition for lupus may develop the disease when they come into contact with something in the environment that can trigger lupus. The cause of lupus in most cases, however, is unknown. Some potential triggers include: - Sunlight. Exposure to the sun may bring on lupus skin lesions or trigger an internal response in susceptible people.   - Infections. Having an infection can initiate lupus or cause a relapse in some people.   - Medications. Lupus can be triggered by certain types of blood pressure medications, anti-seizure medications and antibiotics. People who have drug-induced lupus usually get better when they stop taking the medication. Rarely, symptoms may persist even after the drug is stopped. Factors that may increase your risk of lupus include: - Your sex. Lupus is more common in women.   - Age. Although lupus affects people of all ages, it's most often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 45.   - Race. Lupus is more common in African-Americans, Hispanics and Asian-Americans. Diagnosing lupus is difficult because signs and symptoms vary considerably from person to person. Signs and symptoms of lupus may vary over time and overlap with those of many other disorders. No one test can diagnose lupus. The combination of blood and urine tests, signs and symptoms, and physical examination findings leads to the diagnosis. Laboratory tests Blood and urine tests may include: - Complete blood count. This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets as well as the amount of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. Results may indicate you have anemia, which commonly occurs in lupus. A low white blood cell or platelet count may occur in lupus as well. - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate. This blood test determines the rate at which red blood cells settle to the bottom of a tube in an hour. A faster than normal rate may indicate a systemic disease, such as lupus. The sedimentation rate isn't specific for any one disease. It may be elevated if you have lupus, an infection, another inflammatory condition or cancer. - Kidney and liver assessment. Blood tests can assess how well your kidneys and liver are functioning. Lupus can affect these organs. - Urinalysis. An examination of a sample of your urine may show an increased protein level or red blood cells in the urine, which may occur if lupus has affected your kidneys. - Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test. A positive test for the presence of these antibodies - produced by your immune system - indicates a stimulated immune system. While most people with lupus have a positive ANA test, most people with a positive ANA do not have lupus. If you test positive for ANA, your doctor may advise more-specific antibody testing. Imaging tests If your doctor suspects that lupus is affecting your lungs or heart, he or she may suggest: - Chest X-ray. An image of your chest may reveal abnormal shadows that suggest fluid or inflammation in your lungs. - Echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to produce real-time images of your beating heart. It can check for problems with your valves and other portions of your heart. Biopsy Lupus can harm your kidneys in many different ways, and treatments can vary, depending on the type of damage that occurs. In some cases, it's necessary to test a small sample of kidney tissue to determine what the best treatment might be. The sample can be obtained with a needle or through a small incision. Skin biopsy is sometimes performed to confirm a diagnosis of lupus affecting the skin. Treatment for lupus depends on your signs and symptoms. Determining whether your signs and symptoms should be treated and what medications to use requires a careful discussion of the benefits and risks with your doctor. As your signs and symptoms flare and subside, you and your doctor may find that you'll need to change medications or dosages. The medications most commonly used to control lupus include: - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as naproxen sodium (Aleve) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), may be used to treat pain, swelling and fever associated with lupus. Stronger NSAIDs are available by prescription. Side effects of NSAIDs include stomach bleeding, kidney problems and an increased risk of heart problems. - Antimalarial drugs. Medications commonly used to treat malaria, such as hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), affect the immune system and can help decrease the risk of lupus flares. Side effects can include stomach upset and, very rarely, damage to the retina of the eye. Regular eye exams are recommended when taking these medications. - Corticosteroids. Prednisone and other types of corticosteroids can counter the inflammation of lupus. High doses of steroids such as methylprednisolone (A-Methapred, Medrol) are often used to control serious disease that involves the kidneys and brain. Side effects include weight gain, easy bruising, thinning bones (osteoporosis), high blood pressure, diabetes and increased risk of infection. The risk of side effects increases with higher doses and longer term therapy. - Immunosuppressants. Drugs that suppress the immune system may be helpful in serious cases of lupus. Examples include azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan), mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) and methotrexate (Trexall). Potential side effects may include an increased risk of infection, liver damage, decreased fertility and an increased risk of cancer. - Biologics. A different type of medication, belimumab (Benlysta) administered intravenously, also reduces lupus symptoms in some people. Side effects include nausea, diarrhea and infections. Rarely, worsening of depression can occur. - Rituximab (Rituxan) can be beneficial in cases of resistant lupus. Side effects include allergic reaction to the intravenous infusion and infections. Take steps to care for your body if you have lupus. Simple measures can help you prevent lupus flares and, should they occur, better cope with the signs and symptoms you experience. Try to: - See your doctor regularly. Having regular checkups instead of only seeing your doctor when your symptoms worsen may help your doctor prevent flare-ups, and can be useful in addressing routine health concerns, such as stress, diet and exercise that can be helpful in preventing lupus complications. - Be sun smart. Because ultraviolet light can trigger a flare, wear protective clothing - such as a hat, long-sleeved shirt and long pants - and use sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 55 every time you go outside. - Get regular exercise. Exercise can help keep your bones strong, reduce your risk of heart attack and promote general well-being. - Don't smoke. Smoking increases your risk of cardiovascular disease and can worsen the effects of lupus on your heart and blood vessels. - Eat a healthy diet. A healthy diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Sometimes you may have dietary restrictions, especially if you have high blood pressure, kidney damage or gastrointestinal problems. - Ask your doctor if you need vitamin D and calcium supplements. There is some evidence to suggest that people with lupus may benefit from supplemental vitamin D. A 1,200- to 1,500-milligram calcium supplement taken daily may help keep your bones healthy. Sometimes people with lupus seek alternative or complementary medicine. However, there aren't any alternative therapies that have been shown to alter the course of lupus, although some may help ease symptoms of the disease. Discuss these treatments with your doctor before initiating them on your own. He or she can help you weigh the benefits and risks and tell you if the treatments will interfere adversely with your current lupus medications. Complementary and alternative treatments for lupus include: - Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Supplements containing this hormone may help fatigue and muscle pain. It may lead to acne in women. - Fish oil. Fish oil supplements contain omega-3 fatty acids that may be beneficial for people with lupus. Preliminary studies have found some promise, though more study is needed. Side effects of fish oil supplements can include nausea, belching and a fishy taste in the mouth. - Acupuncture. This therapy uses tiny needles inserted just under the skin. It may help ease the muscle pain associated with lupus."

        "query": "how do you diagnose anxiety",
        "document": "Anxiety: Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. However, people with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Often, anxiety disorders involve repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). These feelings of anxiety and panic interfere with daily activities, are difficult to control, are out of proportion to the actual danger and can last a long time. You may avoid places or situations to prevent these feelings. Symptoms may start during childhood or the teen years and continue into adulthood. Examples of anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), specific phobias and separation anxiety disorder. You can have more than one anxiety disorder. Sometimes anxiety results from a medical condition that needs treatment. Whatever form of anxiety you have, treatment can help. Anxiety care at Mayo Clinic Common anxiety signs and symptoms include: - Feeling nervous, restless or tense   - Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom   - Having an increased heart rate   - Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation)   - Sweating   - Trembling   - Feeling weak or tired   - Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry   - Having trouble sleeping   - Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems   - Having difficulty controlling worry   - Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety Several types of anxiety disorders exist: - Agoraphobia (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often avoid places or situations that might cause you to panic and make you feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed.   - Anxiety disorder due to a medical condition includes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem.   - Generalized anxiety disorder includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events - even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression.   - Panic disorder involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred.   - Selective mutism is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning.   - Separation anxiety disorder is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles.   - Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others.   - Specific phobias are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people.   - Substance-induced anxiety disorder is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of abusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs.   - Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive. When to see a doctor See your doctor if: - You feel like you're worrying too much and it's interfering with your work, relationships or other parts of your life   - Your fear, worry or anxiety is upsetting to you and difficult to control   - You feel depressed, have trouble with alcohol or drug use, or have other mental health concerns along with anxiety   - You think your anxiety could be linked to a physical health problem   - You have suicidal thoughts or behaviors - if this is the case, seek emergency treatment immediately Your worries may not go away on their own, and they may get worse over time if you don't seek help. See your doctor or a mental health provider before your anxiety gets worse. It's easier to treat if you get help early. The causes of anxiety disorders aren't fully understood. Life experiences such as traumatic events appear to trigger anxiety disorders in people who are already prone to anxiety. Inherited traits also can be a factor. Medical causes For some people, anxiety may be linked to an underlying health issue. In some cases, anxiety signs and symptoms are the first indicators of a medical illness. If your doctor suspects your anxiety may have a medical cause, he or she may order tests to look for signs of a problem. Examples of medical problems that can be linked to anxiety include: - Heart disease   - Diabetes   - Thyroid problems, such as hyperthyroidism   - Respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma   - Drug abuse or withdrawal   - Withdrawal from alcohol, anti-anxiety medications (benzodiazepines) or other medications   - Chronic pain or irritable bowel syndrome   - Rare tumors that produce certain \"fight-or-flight\" hormones Sometimes anxiety can be a side effect of certain medications. It's possible that your anxiety may be due to an underlying medical condition if: - You don't have any blood relatives (such as a parent or sibling) with an anxiety disorder   - You didn't have an anxiety disorder as a child   - You don't avoid certain things or situations because of anxiety   - You have a sudden occurrence of anxiety that seems unrelated to life events and you didn't have a previous history of anxiety These factors may increase your risk of developing an anxiety disorder: - Trauma. Children who endured abuse or trauma or witnessed traumatic events are at higher risk of developing an anxiety disorder at some point in life. Adults who experience a traumatic event also can develop anxiety disorders.   - Stress due to an illness. Having a health condition or serious illness can cause significant worry about issues such as your treatment and your future.   - Stress buildup. A big event or a buildup of smaller stressful life situations may trigger excessive anxiety - for example, a death in the family, work stress or ongoing worry about finances.   - Personality. People with certain personality types are more prone to anxiety disorders than others are.   - Other mental health disorders. People with other mental health disorders, such as depression, often also have an anxiety disorder.    - Having blood relatives with an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders can run in families.   - Drugs or alcohol. Drug or alcohol use or abuse or withdrawal can cause or worsen anxiety. Having an anxiety disorder does more than make you worry. It can also lead to, or worsen, other mental and physical conditions, such as: - Depression (which often occurs with an anxiety disorder) or other mental health disorders   - Substance abuse   - Trouble sleeping (insomnia)   - Digestive or bowel problems   - Headaches and chronic pain   - Social isolation   - Problems functioning at school or work   - Poor quality of life   - Suicide You may start by seeing your primary care doctor to find out if your anxiety could be related to your physical health. Your doctor can check for signs of an underlying medical condition that may need treatment. However, you may need to see a mental health specialist if you have severe anxiety. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions. A psychologist and certain other mental health professionals can diagnose anxiety and provide counseling (psychotherapy). To help diagnose an anxiety disorder and rule out other conditions, your provider may: - Give you a psychological evaluation. This involves describing your thoughts, feelings and behavior to help pinpoint a diagnosis and check for related complications. Anxiety disorders often occur along with other mental health problems - such as depression or substance abuse - which can make diagnosis more challenging. - Compare your symptoms to the criteria in the DSM-5. Many doctors use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, to diagnose an anxiety disorder. The two main treatments for anxiety disorders are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you. Psychotherapy Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. It can be an effective treatment for anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective form of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders. Generally a short-term treatment, CBT focuses on teaching you specific skills to improve your symptoms and gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety. CBT includes exposure therapy, in which you gradually encounter the object or situation that triggers your anxiety so you build confidence that you can manage the situation and anxiety symptoms. Medications Several types of medications are used to help relieve symptoms, depending on the type of anxiety disorder you have and whether you also have other mental or physical health issues. For example: - Certain antidepressants are also used to treat anxiety disorders. - An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be prescribed. - In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe a certain type of sedative called a benzodiazepine for short-term relief of anxiety symptoms. Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects of medications. While most people with anxiety disorders need psychotherapy or medications to get anxiety under control, lifestyle changes also can make a difference. Here's what you can do: - Keep physically active. Develop a routine so that you're physically active most days of the week. Exercise is a powerful stress reducer. It may improve your mood and help you stay healthy. Start out slowly and gradually increase the amount and intensity of your activities. - Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs. These substances can cause or worsen anxiety. If you can't quit on your own, see your doctor or find a support group to help you. - Quit smoking and cut back or quit drinking caffeinated beverages. Both nicotine and caffeine can worsen anxiety. - Use stress management and relaxation techniques. Visualization techniques, meditation and yoga are examples of relaxation techniques that can ease anxiety. - Make sleep a priority. Do what you can to make sure you're getting enough sleep to feel rested. If you aren't sleeping well, see your doctor. - Eat healthy. Healthy eating - such as focusing on vegetables, fruits, whole grains and fish - may be linked to reduced anxiety, but more research is needed. Several herbal remedies have been studied as a treatment for anxiety, but more research is needed to understand the risks and benefits. Herbal and dietary supplements aren't monitored by the FDA the same way medications are. You can't always be certain of what you're getting and whether it's safe. Some of these supplements can interfere with prescription medications or cause dangerous interactions. Before taking herbal remedies or dietary supplements, talk to your doctor to make sure they're safe for you and won't interact with any medications you take."

        "document": "Pelvic organ prolapse: Pelvic organ prolapse happens when the muscles and tissues supporting the pelvic organs (the uterus, bladder, or rectum) become weak or loose. This allows one or more of the pelvic organs to drop or press into or out of the vagina. Many women are embarrassed to talk to their doctor about their symptoms or think that their symptoms are normal. But pelvic organ prolapse is treatable. The pelvic muscles and tissues support the pelvic organs like a hammock. The pelvic organs include the bladder, uterus and cervix, vagina, and rectum, which is part of the bowel. A prolapse happens when the pelvis muscles and tissues can no longer support these organs because the muscles and tissues are weak or damaged. This causes one or more pelvic organs to drop or press into or out of the vagina.  Pelvic organ prolapse is a type of pelvic floor disorder. The most common pelvic floor disorders are: The different types of pelvic organ prolapse depend on the pelvic organ affected. The most common types include:  Although it is rare, pelvic organ prolapse can also happen after a hysterectomy. Any part of the vaginal wall may drop, causing a bulge into or out of the vagina. Pelvic floor disorders (urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse) affect one in five women in the United States.1 Pelvic organ prolapse is less common than urinary or fecal incontinence but affects almost 3% of U.S. women.1 Pelvic organ prolapse happens more often in older women and in white and Hispanic women than in younger women or women of other racial and ethnic groups.2,3  Some women develop more than one pelvic floor disorder, such as pelvic organ prolapse with urinary incontinence. The pressure from prolapse can cause a bulge in the vagina that can sometimes be felt or seen. Women with pelvic organ prolapse may feel uncomfortable pressure during physical activity or sex.  Other symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse include:  Some women say that their symptoms are worse at certain times of the day, during physical activity, or after standing for a long time. Talk to your doctor or nurse about your symptoms. Pelvic organ prolapse happens when the muscles or connective tissues of the pelvis do not work as they should. The most common risk factors are: Your doctor will talk to you about your symptoms and do a pelvic exam. You may be asked to strain or cough during the exam so your doctor can see whether these actions cause prolapse or urine leakage. Your doctor may also do other tests to see whether you can completely empty your bladder when you go to the bathroom. Treatment for pelvic organ prolapse depends on the type of prolapse you have, your symptoms, your age, other health problems, and whether you are sexually active.  Your treatment may include one or more of the following: Researchers are studying ways to prevent pelvic organ prolapse. The following steps may reduce your risk of getting a pelvic floor problem: For more information about pelvic organ prolapse, call the OWH Helpline at 1-800-994-9662 or contact the following organizations:"

The exact cause of myasthenia gravis is unknown. In some cases, it is linked to tumors of the thymus (an organ of the immune system).   Myasthenia gravis can affect people at any age. It is most common in young women and older men. Myasthenia gravis causes weakness of the voluntary muscles -- muscles that are under your control. Autonomic muscles of the heart and digestive tract are usually not affected. The muscle weakness of myasthenia gravis worsens with activity and improves with rest.   This muscle weakness can lead to a variety of symptoms, including:      - Breathing difficulty because of weakness of the chest wall muscles   - Chewing or swallowing difficulty, causing frequent gagging, choking, or drooling   - Difficulty climbing stairs, lifting objects, or rising from a seated position   - Difficulty talking   - Drooping head and eyelids   - Facial paralysis or weakness of the facial muscles   - Fatigue   - Hoarseness or changing voice   - Double vision   - Difficulty maintaining steady gaze The health care provider will perform a physical exam. This includes a detailed nervous system (neurological) examination. This may show:     - Muscle weakness, with eye muscles usually affected first   - Normal reflexes and feeling (sensation)      Tests that may be done include:     - Acetylcholine receptor antibodies associated with this disease   - CT or MRI scan of the chest to look for a tumor   - Nerve conduction studies   - EMG   - Pulmonary function tests   - Edrophonium test to see if this medicine reverses the symptoms for a short time There is no known cure for myasthenia gravis. Treatment may allow you to have periods without any symptoms (remission).   Lifestyle changes can often help you continue your daily activities. The following may be recommended:     - Resting throughout the day   - Using an eye patch if double vision is bothersome   - Avoiding stress and heat exposure, which can make symptoms worse      Medicines that may be prescribed include:     - Neostigmine or pyridostigmine to improve communication between the nerves and muscles   - Prednisone and other drugs (such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, or mycophenolate mofetil) to suppress the immune system response if you have severe symptoms and other medicines have not worked well.      Crisis situations are attacks of weakness of the breathing muscles. These attacks can occur without warning when either too much or too little medicine is taken. These attacks usually last no longer than a few weeks. You may need to be admitted to the hospital, where you may need breathing assistance with a ventilator.   A procedure called plasmapheresis may also be used to help end the crisis. This procedure involves removing the clear part of the blood (plasma), which contains the antibodies. This is replaced with donated plasma that is free of antibodies, or with other fluids. Plasmapheresis may also help reduce symptoms for 4 to 6 weeks and is often used before surgery.   Another procedure, called intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), may also be done. With this procedure, a large amount of helpful antibodies are given directly into the bloodstream.   Surgery to remove the thymus (thymectomy) may result in permanent remission or less need for medicines, especially when there is a tumor present.   If you have eye problems, your doctor may suggest lens prisms to improve vision. Surgery may also be recommended to treat your eye muscles.   Physical therapy can help maintain your muscle strength. This is especially important for the muscles that support breathing.   Some medicines can worsen symptoms and should be avoided. Before taking any medicine, ask your doctor whether it is\u00a0OK for you to take it. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a\u00a0myasthenia gravis support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. There is no cure, but long-term remission is possible. You may have to restrict some daily activities. People who have only eye symptoms (ocular myasthenia gravis), may develop generalized myasthenia over time.   A woman with myasthenia gravis can get pregnant, but careful prenatal care is important. The baby may be weak and require medications for a few weeks after birth, but usually will not develop the disorder. The condition may cause life-threatening breathing problems. This is called a myasthenic crisis.   Patients with myasthenia gravis are at higher risk for other autoimmune disorders, such as thyrotoxicosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus). Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of myasthenia gravis.   Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have breathing difficulty or swallowing problems.

        "document": "Pulmonary Hypertension (Causes): Pulmonary hypertension (PH) begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH. Many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of PH. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may have no known cause, or the condition may be inherited. (\"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) Some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 PAH. Examples include HIV infection, congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease. Also, the use of street drugs (such as cocaine) and certain diet medicines can lead to PAH.

        "query": "how do you get pulmonary hypertension",
        "document": "Pulmonary hypertension (Causes): Your heart has two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery). In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart. Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs. With pulmonary hypertension, the rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, and extra tissue may form. The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight. These changes in the pulmonary arteries can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels. This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, depending on the cause. Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension - Cause unknown, known as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension   - A specific gene mutation that can cause pulmonary hypertension to develop in families, also called heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension   - Certain drugs - such as certain prescription diet drugs or illegal drugs such as methamphetamines - or certain toxins   - Heart abnormalities present at birth (congenital heart disease)   - Other conditions, such as connective tissue disorders (scleroderma, lupus, others), HIV infection or chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension caused by left-sided heart disease - Left-sided valvular heart disease, such as mitral valve or aortic valve disease   - Failure of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension caused by lung disease - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as emphysema   - Lung disease such as pulmonary fibrosis, a condition that causes scarring in the tissue between the lungs' air sacs (interstitium)   - Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders   - Long-term exposure to high altitudes in people who may be at higher risk of pulmonary hypertension Group 4: Pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic blood clots - Chronic blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary emboli) Group 5: Pulmonary hypertension associated with other conditions that have unclear reasons why the pulmonary hypertension occurs - Blood disorders   - Disorders that affect several organs in the body, such as sarcoidosis   - Metabolic disorders, such as glycogen storage disease   - Tumors pressing against pulmonary arteries Eisenmenger syndrome and pulmonary hypertension Eisenmenger syndrome, a type of congenital heart disease, causes pulmonary hypertension. It's most commonly caused by a large hole in your heart between the two lower heart chambers (ventricles), called a ventricular septal defect. This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart. Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood). The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension."

        "document": "How to diagnose Pulmonary Hypertension?: Your doctor will diagnose pulmonary hypertension (PH) based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and the results from tests and procedures.  PH can develop slowly. In fact, you may have it for years and not know it. This is because the condition has no early signs or symptoms.  When symptoms do occur, they're often like those of other heart and lung conditions, such as asthma. This makes PH hard to diagnose.  Medical and Family Histories  Your doctor may ask about your signs and symptoms and how and when they began. He or she also may ask whether you have other medical conditions that can cause PH.  Your doctor will want to know whether you have any family members who have or have had PH. People who have a family history of PH are at higher risk for the condition.  Physical Exam  During the physical exam, your doctor will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. He or she also will check your ankles and legs for swelling and your lips and skin for a bluish color. These are signs of PH.  Diagnostic Tests and Procedures  Your doctor may recommend tests and procedures to confirm a diagnosis of PH and to look for its underlying cause. Your doctor also will use test results to find out the severity of your PH.  Tests and Procedures To Confirm a Diagnosis  Echocardiography. Echocardiography (EK-o-kar-de-OG-ra-fee), or echo, uses sound waves to create a moving picture of your heart. This test can estimate the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. Echo also can show the size and thickness of your right ventricle and how well it's working.  Chest x ray. A chest x ray takes pictures of the structures in your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This test can show whether your pulmonary arteries and right ventricle are enlarged.  The pulmonary arteries and right ventricle may get larger if the right ventricle has to work hard to pump blood through the pulmonary arteries.  A chest x ray also may show signs of an underlying lung disease that's causing or contributing to PH.  EKG (electrocardiogram). An EKG is a simple, painless test that records the heart's electrical activity. This test also shows whether your heart's rhythm is steady or irregular. An EKG may show whether your right ventricle is enlarged or strained.  Right heart catheterization. This procedure measures the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. It also shows how well your heart is pumping blood to the rest of your body. Right heart catheterization (KATH-e-ter-ih-ZA-shun) can find any leaks between the left and right side of the heart.  During this procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is put into a blood vessel in your groin (upper thigh) or neck. The tube is threaded into the right side of your heart and into the pulmonary arteries. Through the tube, your doctor can do tests and treatments on your heart.  Tests To Look for the Underlying Cause of Pulmonary Hypertension  PH has many causes, so many tests may need to be done to find its underlying cause.  Chest CT scan. A chest computed tomography (to-MOG-ra-fee) scan, or chest CT scan, creates pictures of the structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. These pictures can show signs of PH or a condition that may be causing PH.  Chest MRI. Chest magnetic resonance imaging, or chest MRI, shows how your right ventricle is working. The test also shows blood flow in your lungs. Chest MRI also can help detect signs of PH or an underlying condition causing PH.  Lung function tests. Lung function tests measure how much air you can breathe in and out, how fast you can breathe air out, and how well your lungs deliver oxygen to your blood. These tests can help detect a lung disease that may be causing PH.  Polysomnogram (PSG). This test records brain activity, eye movements, heart rate, and blood pressure while you sleep. A PSG also measures the level of oxygen in your blood. A low oxygen level during sleep is common in PH, and it can make the condition worse.  A PSG usually is done while you stay overnight at a sleep center. For more information about this test, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Sleep Studies article.  Lung ventilation/perfusion (VQ) scan. A lung VQ scan measures air and blood flow in your lungs. This test can help detect blood clots in your lung's blood vessels.  Blood tests. Blood tests are used to rule out other diseases, such as HIV, liver disease, and autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis).  Finding Out the Severity of Pulmonary Hypertension  Exercise testing is used to find out the severity of PH. This testing consists of either a 6-minute walk test or a cardiopulmonary exercise test.  A 6-minute walk test measures the distance you can quickly walk in 6 minutes. A cardiopulmonary exercise test measures how well your lungs and heart work while you exercise on a treadmill or bicycle.  During exercise testing, your doctor will rate your activity level. Your level is linked to the severity of your PH. The rating system ranges from class 1 to class 4.  Class 1 has no limits. You can do regular physical activities, such as walking or climbing stairs. These activities don't cause PH symptoms, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, or chest pain.  Class 2 has slight or mild limits. You're comfortable while resting, but regular physical activity causes PH symptoms.  Class 3 has marked or noticeable limits. You're comfortable while resting. However, walking even one or two blocks or climbing one flight of stairs can cause PH symptoms.  Class 4 has severe limits. You're not able to do any physical activity without discomfort. You also may have PH symptoms while at rest.  Over time, you may need more exercise tests to find out how well your treatments are working. Each time testing is done, your doctor will compare your activity level with the previous one."

        "document": "Pulmonary hypertension (Causes): The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body.   When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension.   The heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, this causes the right side of the heart to become larger. This condition is called right-sided heart failure, or cor pulmonale.   Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by:     - Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis   - Birth defects of the heart   - Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism)   - Heart failure   - Heart valve disease   - HIV infection   - Low oxygen levels in the blood for a long time (chronic)   - Lung disease, such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis   - Medicines (for example, certain diet drugs)   - Obstructive sleep apnea     In rare cases, the cause of pulmonary hypertension is unknown. In this case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Idiopathic means the cause of a disease is not known. IPAH affects more women than men.   If pulmonary hypertension is caused by a known medicine or medical condition, it is called secondary pulmonary hypertension."

Inherited cases of this disorder are known as familial pulmonary arterial hypertension. When the condition is inherited, it most often has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

Interpreting the numbers In the United States, cholesterol levels are measured in milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dL) of blood. In Canada and many European countries, cholesterol levels are measured in millimoles per liter (mmol/L). To interpret your test results, use these general guidelines. Children and cholesterol testing For most children, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommends one cholesterol screening test between the ages of 9 and 11, and another cholesterol screening test between the ages of 17 and 21. Cholesterol testing is usually avoided between the ages of 12 and 16 because false-negative results are more likely within this age group.

        "document": "Heart attack (Treatment): IMMEDIATE TREATMENT      - You will be hooked up to a heart monitor, so the health care team can see how regularly your heart is beating.   - You will receive oxygen so that your heart doesn't have to work as hard.   - An intravenous line (IV) will be placed into one of your veins. Medicines and fluids pass through this IV.   - You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain.   - You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. In that case, you will be given another medicine that prevents blood clots.   - Dangerous abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) may be treated with medicine or electric shocks.       EMERGENCY PROCEDURES    Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart.      - Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment. It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack.   - A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again.      You may be given drugs to break up the clot. This is called thrombolytic therapy. It is best if these drugs are given soon after the onset of symptoms, usually no later than 12 hours after it and ideally within 30 minutes of arriving to the hospital.   Some people may also have heart bypass surgery to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. This procedure is also called coronary artery bypass grafting and/or open heart surgery.    TREATMENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK    After several days, you will be discharged from the hospital.   You will likely need to take medicines, some for the rest of your life. Always talk to your provider before stopping or changing how you take any medicines. Stopping certain medicines can be deadly.    While under the care of your health care team, you will learn:     - How to take medicines to treat your heart problem and prevent more heart attacks   - How to eat a heart-healthy diet   - How to be active and exercise safely   - What to do when you have chest pain   - How to stop smoking      Strong emotions are common after a heart attack.     - You may feel sad   - You may feel anxious and worry about being careful about everything you do      All of these feelings are normal. They go away for most people after 2 or 3 weeks.   You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital to go home.   Most people who have had a heart attack take part in a cardiac rehabilitation program."

        "document": "Heart attack (Lifestyle and home remedies): Your lifestyle affects your heart health. The following steps can help you not only prevent but also recover from a heart attack: - Avoid smoke. The most important thing you can do to improve your heart's health is to not smoke. Also, avoid being around secondhand smoke. If you need to quit, ask your doctor for help. - Control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. If one or both of these is high, your doctor can prescribe changes to your diet and medications. Ask your doctor how often you need to have your blood pressure and cholesterol levels monitored. - Get regular medical checkups. Some of the major risk factors for heart attack - high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes - cause no symptoms early on. Your doctor can perform tests to check for these conditions and help you manage them, if necessary. - Exercise regularly. Regular exercise helps improve heart muscle function after a heart attack and helps prevent a heart attack by helping you to control your weight, diabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure. Exercise needn't be vigorous. Walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week can improve your health. - Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight strains your heart and can contribute to high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. - Eat a heart-healthy diet. Saturated fat, trans fats and cholesterol in your diet can narrow arteries to your heart, and too much salt can raise blood pressure. Eat a heart-healthy diet that includes lean proteins, such as fish and beans, plenty of fruits and vegetables and whole grains. - Manage diabetes. High blood sugar is damaging to your heart. Regular exercise, eating well and losing weight all help to keep blood sugar levels at more-desirable levels. Many people also need medication to manage their diabetes. - Control stress. Reduce stress in your day-to-day activities. Rethink workaholic habits and find healthy ways to minimize or deal with stressful events in your life. - If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger."

        "document": "Heart attack (Treatment): Heart attack treatment at a hospital With each passing minute after a heart attack, more heart tissue loses oxygen and deteriorates or dies. The main way to prevent heart damage is to restore blood flow quickly. Medications Medications given to treat a heart attack include: - Aspirin. The 911 operator may instruct you to take aspirin, or emergency medical personnel may give you aspirin immediately. Aspirin reduces blood clotting, thus helping maintain blood flow through a narrowed artery. - Thrombolytics. These drugs, also called clotbusters, help dissolve a blood clot that's blocking blood flow to your heart. The earlier you receive a thrombolytic drug after a heart attack, the greater the chance you'll survive and with less heart damage. - Antiplatelet agents. Emergency room doctors may give you other drugs to help prevent new clots and keep existing clots from getting larger. These include medications, such as clopidogrel (Plavix) and others, called platelet aggregation inhibitors. - Other blood-thinning medications. You'll likely be given other medications, such as heparin, to make your blood less \"sticky\" and less likely to form clots. Heparin is given intravenously or by an injection under your skin. - Pain relievers. You may receive a pain reliever, such as morphine, to ease your discomfort. - Nitroglycerin. This medication, used to treat chest pain (angina), can help improve blood flow to the heart by widening (dilating) the blood vessels. - Beta blockers. These medications help relax your heart muscle, slow your heartbeat and decrease blood pressure, making your heart's job easier. Beta blockers can limit the amount of heart muscle damage and prevent future heart attacks. - ACE inhibitors. These drugs lower blood pressure and reduce stress on the heart. Surgical and other procedures In addition to medications, you may undergo one of the following procedures to treat your heart attack: - Coronary angioplasty and stenting. Doctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) that's passed through an artery, usually in your leg or groin, to a blocked artery in your heart. If you've had a heart attack, this procedure is often done immediately after a cardiac catheterization, a procedure used to locate blockages. This catheter is equipped with a special balloon that, once in position, is briefly inflated to open a blocked coronary artery. A metal mesh stent may be inserted into the artery to keep it open long term, restoring blood flow to the heart. Depending on your condition, your doctor may opt to place a stent coated with a slow-releasing medication to help keep your artery open. - Coronary artery bypass surgery. In some cases, doctors may perform emergency bypass surgery at the time of a heart attack. If possible, your doctor may suggest that you have bypass surgery after your heart has had time - about three to seven days - to recover from your heart attack. Bypass surgery involves sewing veins or arteries in place beyond a blocked or narrowed coronary artery, allowing blood flow to the heart to bypass the narrowed section. Once blood flow to your heart is restored and your condition is stable, you're likely to remain in the hospital for several days."

        "document": "Asthma (Diagnosis): Physical exam To rule out other possible conditions - such as a respiratory infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - your doctor will do a physical exam and ask you questions about your signs and symptoms and about any other health problems. Tests to measure lung function You may also be given lung (pulmonary) function tests to determine how much air moves in and out as you breathe. These tests may include: - Spirometry. This test estimates the narrowing of your bronchial tubes by checking how much air you can exhale after a deep breath and how fast you can breathe out. - Peak flow. A peak flow meter is a simple device that measures how hard you can breathe out. Lower than usual peak flow readings are a sign your lungs may not be working as well and that your asthma may be getting worse. Your doctor will give you instructions on how to track and deal with low peak flow readings. Lung function tests often are done before and after taking a medication called a bronchodilator (brong-koh-DIE-lay-tur), such as albuterol, to open your airways. If your lung function improves with use of a bronchodilator, it's likely you have asthma. Additional tests Other tests to diagnose asthma include: - Methacholine challenge. Methacholine is a known asthma trigger that, when inhaled, will cause mild constriction of your airways. If you react to the methacholine, you likely have asthma. This test may be used even if your initial lung function test is normal. - Nitric oxide test. This test, though not widely available, measures the amount of the gas, nitric oxide, that you have in your breath. When your airways are inflamed - a sign of asthma - you may have higher than normal nitric oxide levels. - Imaging tests. A chest X-ray and high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) scan of your lungs and nose cavities (sinuses) can identify any structural abnormalities or diseases (such as infection) that can cause or aggravate breathing problems. - Allergy testing. This can be performed by a skin test or blood test. Allergy tests can identify allergy to pets, dust, mold and pollen. If important allergy triggers are identified, this can lead to a recommendation for allergen immunotherapy. - Sputum eosinophils. This test looks for certain white blood cells (eosinophils) in the mixture of saliva and mucus (sputum) you discharge during coughing. Eosinophils are present when symptoms develop and become visible when stained with a rose-colored dye (eosin). - Provocative testing for exercise and cold-induced asthma. In these tests, your doctor measures your airway obstruction before and after you perform vigorous physical activity or take several breaths of cold air. How asthma is classified To classify your asthma severity, your doctor considers your answers to questions about symptoms (such as how often you have asthma attacks and how bad they are), along with the results of your physical exam and diagnostic tests. Determining your asthma severity helps your doctor choose the best treatment. Asthma severity often changes over time, requiring treatment adjustments. Asthma is classified into four general categories:"

Poor lung function is a sign that your asthma isn't well-controlled. In some cases, lung function tests are also used in asthma emergencies to help check the severity of an asthma attack or how well treatment is working. Lung function tests include: - Peak flow. Your doctor may take a peak flow reading when you come in for a scheduled visit or for emergency treatment during an asthma attack. This test measures how quickly you can breathe out. You also may use a peak flow meter at home to monitor your lung function. The results of this test are known as peak expiratory flow (PEF). A peak flow test is done by blowing into a mouthpiece as hard and as fast as you can with a single breath (expiration). - Spirometry. During spirometry, you take deep breaths and forcefully exhale into a hose connected to a machine called a spirometer. A common spirometry measurement is forced expiratory volume, which measures how much air you can breathe out in one second. The results of this test are known as forced expiratory volume (FEV). Spirometry can also measure how much air your lungs can hold and the rate at which you can inhale and exhale. - Nitric oxide measurement. A newer diagnostic test, this exam measures the amount of nitric oxide gas you have in your breath when you exhale. High nitric oxide readings indicate inflammation of the bronchial tubes. Exhaled nitric oxide can be measured by having a patient exhale directly into an analyzer. Exhaled air may be captured in a nitric-oxide-impervious container for measurement later. - Pulse oximetry. This test is used during a severe asthma attack. It measures the amount of oxygen in your blood. It's measured through your fingernail and only takes seconds."

He or she also may ask whether you have asthma symptoms and when and how often they occur. Let your doctor know whether your symptoms seem to happen only during certain times of the year or in certain places, or if they get worse at night. Your doctor also may want to know what factors seem to trigger your symptoms or worsen them. For more information about possible asthma triggers, go to \"What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?\" Your doctor may ask you about related health conditions that can interfere with asthma management. These conditions include a runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. Physical Exam Your doctor will listen to your breathing and look for signs of asthma or allergies. These signs include wheezing, a runny nose or swollen nasal passages, and allergic skin conditions (such as eczema). Keep in mind that you can still have asthma even if you don't have these signs on the day that your doctor examines you. Diagnostic Tests Lung Function Test Your doctor will use a test called spirometry (spi-ROM-eh-tre) to check how your lungs are working. This test measures how much air you can breathe in and out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out. Your doctor also may give you medicine and then test you again to see whether the results have improved. If the starting results are lower than normal and improve with the medicine, and if your medical history shows a pattern of asthma symptoms, your diagnosis will likely be asthma. Other Tests Your doctor may recommend other tests if he or she needs more information to make a diagnosis. Other tests may include: Allergy testing to find out which allergens affect you, if any. A test to measure how sensitive your airways are. This is called a bronchoprovocation (brong-KO-prav-eh-KA-shun) test. Using spirometry, this test repeatedly measures your lung function during physical activity or after you receive increasing doses of cold air or a special chemical to breathe in. A test to show whether you have another condition with the same symptoms as asthma, such as reflux disease, vocal cord dysfunction, or sleep apnea. A chest x ray or an EKG (electrocardiogram). These tests will help find out whether a foreign object or other disease may be causing your symptoms. Diagnosing Asthma in Young Children Most children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before 5 years of age. However, asthma in young children (aged 0 to 5 years) can be hard to diagnose. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition. This is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions. Also, many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections don't go on to have asthma after they're 6 years old. A child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections. The airways grow as the child grows older, so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds. A young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if: One or both parents have asthma The child has signs of allergies, including the allergic skin condition eczema The child has allergic reactions to pollens or other airborne allergens The child wheezes even when he or she doesn't have a cold or other infection The most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test, a medical history, and a physical exam. However, it's hard to do lung function tests in children younger than 5 years. Thus, doctors must rely on children's medical histories, signs and symptoms, and physical exams to make a diagnosis. Doctors also may use a 4\u20136 week trial of asthma medicines to see how well a child responds."

Other signs include:     - Hole, split, or cleft in the iris of the eye (coloboma)   - Separation between the left and right side of the abdominal muscle (diastasis recti)   - Umbilical hernia or inguinal hernia     There are often signs of congenital heart disease, such as:     - Atrial septal defect (ASD)   - Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)   - Ventricular septal defect (VSD)      Tests may also show kidney problems, including:     - Horseshoe kidney   - Hydronephrosis   - Polycystic kidney There are no specific treatments for trisomy 18. Which treatments are used depend on the person's individual condition. Support groups include:     - Support Organization for Trisomy 18, 13 and Related Disorders (SOFT): trisomy.org   - Trisomy 18 Foundation: www.trisomy18.org   - Hope for Trisomy 13 and 18: www.hopefortrisomy13and18.org Half of infants with this condition do not survive beyond the first week of life. Nine out of 10 children will die by 1 year of age. Some children have survived to the teenage years, but with serious medical and developmental problems. Complications depend on the specific defects and symptoms. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition, the risks of inheriting it, and how to care for the person. Tests can be done during pregnancy to find out if the child has this syndrome.   Genetic testing is recommended for parents who have a child with this syndrome and who want to have more children.

        "query": "how is gonorrhea diagnosed",
        "document": "Gonorrhea: Gonorrhea is an infection caused by a sexually transmitted bacterium that can infect both males and females. Gonorrhea most often affects the urethra, rectum or throat. In females, gonorrhea can also infect the cervix. Gonorrhea is most commonly spread during sex. But babies can be infected during childbirth if their mothers are infected. In babies, gonorrhea most commonly affects the eyes. Gonorrhea is a common infection that, in many cases, causes no symptoms. You may not even know that you're infected. Abstaining from sex, using a condom if you do have sex and being in a mutually monogamous relationship are the best ways to prevent sexually transmitted infections. In many cases, gonorrhea infection causes no symptoms. When symptoms do appear, gonorrhea infection can affect multiple sites in your body, but it commonly appears in the genital tract. Gonorrhea affecting the genital tract Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea infection in men include: - Painful urination   - Pus-like discharge from the tip of the penis   - Pain or swelling in one testicle Signs and symptoms of gonorrhea infection in women include: - Increased vaginal discharge   - Painful urination   - Vaginal bleeding between periods, such as after vaginal intercourse   - Painful intercourse   - Abdominal or pelvic pain Gonorrhea at other sites in the body Gonorrhea can also affect these parts of the body: - Rectum. Signs and symptoms include anal itching, pus-like discharge from the rectum, spots of bright red blood on toilet tissue and having to strain during bowel movements.   - Eyes. Gonorrhea that affects your eyes may cause eye pain, sensitivity to light, and pus-like discharge from one or both eyes.   - Throat. Signs and symptoms of a throat infection may include a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes in the neck.   - Joints. If one or more joints become infected by bacteria (septic arthritis), the affected joints may be warm, red, swollen and extremely painful, especially when you move an affected joint. When to see your doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any troubling signs or symptoms, such as a burning sensation when you urinate or a pus-like discharge from your penis, vagina or rectum. Also make an appointment with your doctor if your partner has been diagnosed with gonorrhea. You may not experience signs or symptoms that prompt you to seek medical attention. But without treatment, you can reinfect your partner even after he or she has been treated for gonorrhea. Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The gonorrhea bacteria are most often passed from one person to another during sexual contact, including oral, anal or vaginal intercourse. Factors that may increase your risk of gonorrhea infection include: - Younger age   - A new sex partner   - A sex partner who has concurrent partners   - Multiple sex partners   - Previous gonorrhea diagnosis   - Having other sexually transmitted infections Untreated gonorrhea can lead to significant complications, such as: - Infertility in women. Untreated gonorrhea can spread into the uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which may result in scarring of the tubes, greater risk of pregnancy complications and infertility. PID is a serious infection that requires immediate treatment.   - Infertility in men. Men with untreated gonorrhea can experience epididymitis - inflammation of a small, coiled tube in the rear portion of the testicles where the sperm ducts are located (epididymis). Epididymitis is treatable, but if left untreated, it may lead to infertility.   - Infection that spreads to the joints and other areas of your body. The bacterium that causes gonorrhea can spread through the bloodstream and infect other parts of your body, including your joints. Fever, rash, skin sores, joint pain, swelling and stiffness are possible results.   - Increased risk of HIV/AIDS. Having gonorrhea makes you more susceptible to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that leads to AIDS. People who have both gonorrhea and HIV are able to pass both diseases more readily to their partners.   - Complications in babies. Babies who contract gonorrhea from their mothers during birth can develop blindness, sores on the scalp and infections. To determine whether the gonorrhea bacterium is present in your body, your doctor will analyze a sample of cells. Samples can be collected by: - Urine test. This may help identify bacteria in your urethra. - Swab of affected area. A swab of your throat, urethra, vagina or rectum may collect bacteria that can be identified in a laboratory. For women, home test kits are available for gonorrhea. Home test kits include vaginal swabs for self-testing that are sent to a specified lab for testing. If you prefer, you can choose to be notified by email or text message when your results are ready. You may then view your results online or receive them by calling a toll-free hotline. Testing for other sexually transmitted infections Your doctor may recommend tests for other sexually transmitted infections. Gonorrhea increases your risk of these infections, particularly chlamydia, which often accompanies gonorrhea. Testing for HIV also is recommended for anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection. Depending on your risk factors, tests for additional sexually transmitted infections could be beneficial as well. Gonorrhea treatment in adults Adults with gonorrhea are treated with antibiotics. Due to emerging strains of drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that uncomplicated gonorrhea be treated only with the antibiotic ceftriaxone - given as an injection - in combination with either azithromycin (Zithromax, Zmax) or doxycycline (Monodox, Vibramycin, others) - two antibiotics that are taken orally. Some research indicates that oral gemifloxacin (Factive) or injectable gentamicin, combined with oral azithromycin, is highly successful in treating gonorrhea. This treatment may be helpful in treating people who are allergic to cephalosporin antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone. Gonorrhea treatment for partners Your partner also should undergo testing and treatment for gonorrhea, even if he or she has no signs or symptoms. Your partner receives the same treatment you do. Even if you've been treated for gonorrhea, you can be reinfected if your partner isn't treated. Gonorrhea treatment for babies Babies born to mothers with gonorrhea receive a medication in their eyes soon after birth to prevent infection. If an eye infection develops, babies can be treated with antibiotics."

        "query": "how is hemophilia treated",
        "document": "Hemophilia: Espa\u00f1ol Hemophilia (heem-o-FILL-ee-ah) is a rare bleeding disorder in which the blood doesn't clot normally. If you have hemophilia, you may bleed for a longer time than others after an injury. You also may bleed inside your body (internally), especially in your knees, ankles, and elbows. This bleeding can damage your organs and tissues and may be life threatening. Overview Hemophilia usually is inherited. \"Inherited\u201d means that the disorder is passed from parents to children through genes. People born with hemophilia have little or no clotting factor. Clotting factor is a protein needed for normal blood clotting. There are several types of clotting factors. These proteins work with platelets (PLATE-lets) to help the blood clot. Platelets are small blood cell fragments that form in the bone marrow\u2014a sponge-like tissue in the bones. Platelets play a major role in blood clotting. When blood vessels are injured, clotting factors help platelets stick together to plug cuts and breaks on the vessels and stop bleeding. The two main types of hemophilia are A and B. If you have hemophilia A, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor VIII (8). About 8 out of 10 people who have hemophilia have type A. If you have hemophilia B, you're missing or have low levels of clotting factor IX (9). Rarely, hemophilia can be acquired. \"Acquired\u201d means you aren't born with the disorder, but you develop it during your lifetime. This can happen if your body forms antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factors in your bloodstream. The antibodies can prevent the clotting factors from working. This article focuses on inherited hemophilia. Outlook Hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how much clotting factor is in your blood. About 7 out of 10 people who have hemophilia A have the severe form of the disorder. People who don't have hemophilia have a factor VIII activity of 100 percent. People who have severe hemophilia A have a factor VIII activity of less than\u00a0 1 percent. Hemophilia usually occurs in males (with rare exceptions). About 1 in 5,000 males are born with hemophilia each year. Hemophilia A Classic hemophilia Factor VIII deficiency Hemophilia B Christmas disease Factor IX deficiency A defect in one of the genes that determines how the body makes blood clotting factor VIII or IX causes hemophilia. These genes are located on the X chromosomes (KRO-muh-somz). Chromosomes come in pairs. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Only the X chromosome carries the genes related to clotting factors. A male who has a hemophilia gene on his X chromosome will have hemophilia. When a female has a hemophilia gene on only one of her X chromosomes, she is a \"hemophilia carrier\u201d and can pass the gene to her children. Sometimes carriers have low levels of clotting factor and have symptoms of hemophilia, including bleeding. Clotting factors are proteins in the blood that work together with platelets to stop or control bleeding. Very rarely, a girl may be born with a very low clotting factor level and have a greater risk for bleeding, similar to boys who have hemophilia and very low levels of clotting factor. There are several hereditary and genetic causes of this much rarer form of hemophilia in females. Some males who have the disorder are born to mothers who aren't carriers. In these cases, a mutation (random change) occurs in the gene as it is passed to the child. Below are two examples of how the hemophilia gene is inherited. Inheritance Pattern for Hemophilia\u2014Example 1 Each daughter has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from her mother and being a carrier. Each son has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the hemophilia gene from his mother and having hemophilia. Inheritance Pattern for Hemophilia\u2014Example 2 Each daughter will inherit the hemophilia gene from her father and be a carrier. None of the sons will inherit the hemophilia gene from their father; thus, none will have hemophilia. The major signs and symptoms of hemophilia are excessive bleeding and easy bruising. Excessive Bleeding The extent of bleeding depends on how severe the hemophilia is. Children who have mild hemophilia may not have signs unless they have excessive bleeding from a dental procedure, an accident, or surgery. Males who have severe hemophilia may bleed heavily after circumcision. Bleeding can occur on the body's surface (external bleeding) or inside the body (internal bleeding). Signs of external bleeding may include: Bleeding in the mouth from a cut or bite or from cutting or losing a tooth Nosebleeds for no obvious reason Heavy bleeding from a minor cut Bleeding from a cut that resumes after stopping for a short time Signs of internal bleeding may include: Blood in the urine (from bleeding in the kidneys or bladder) Blood in the stool (from bleeding in the intestines or stomach) Large bruises (from bleeding into the large muscles of the body) Bleeding in the Joints Bleeding in the knees, elbows, or other joints is another common form of internal bleeding in people who have hemophilia. This bleeding can occur without obvious injury. At first, the bleeding causes tightness in the joint with no real pain or any visible signs of bleeding. The joint then becomes swollen, hot to touch, and painful to bend. Swelling continues as bleeding continues. Eventually, movement in the joint is temporarily lost. Pain can be severe. Joint bleeding that isn't treated quickly can damage the joint. Bleeding in the Brain Internal bleeding in the brain is a very serious complication of hemophilia. It can happen after a simple bump on the head or a more serious injury. The signs and symptoms of bleeding in the brain include: Long-lasting, painful headaches or neck pain or stiffness Repeated vomiting Sleepiness or changes in behavior Sudden weakness or clumsiness of the arms or legs or problems walking Double vision Convulsions or seizures If you or your child appears to have a bleeding problem, your doctor will ask about your personal and family medical histories. This will reveal whether you or your family members, including women and girls, have bleeding problems. However, some people who have hemophilia have no recent family history of the disease. You or your child also will likely have a physical exam and blood tests to diagnose hemophilia. Blood tests are used to find out: How long it takes for your blood to clot Whether your blood has low levels of any clotting factors Whether any clotting factors are completely missing from your blood The test results will show whether you have hemophilia, what type of hemophilia you have, and how severe it is. Hemophilia A and B are classified as mild, moderate, or severe, depending on the amount of clotting factor VIII or IX in the blood. The severity of symptoms can overlap between the categories. For example, some people who have mild hemophilia may have bleeding problems almost as often or as severe as some people who have moderate hemophilia. Severe hemophilia can cause serious bleeding problems in babies. Thus, children who have severe hemophilia usually are diagnosed during the first year of life. People who have milder forms of hemophilia may not be diagnosed until they're adults. The bleeding problems of hemophilia A and hemophilia B are the same. Only special blood tests can tell which type of the disorder you or your child has. Knowing which type is important because the treatments are different. Pregnant women who are known hemophilia carriers can have the disorder diagnosed in their unborn babies as early as 12 weeks into their pregnancies. Women who are hemophilia carriers also can have \"preimplantation diagnosis\" to have children who don't have hemophilia. For this process, women have their eggs removed and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory. The embryos are then tested for hemophilia. Only embryos without the disorder are implanted in the womb. Treatment With Replacement Therapy The main treatment for hemophilia is called replacement therapy. Concentrates of clotting factor VIII (for hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (for hemophilia B) are slowly dripped or injected into a vein. These infusions help replace the clotting factor that's missing or low. Clotting factor concentrates can be made from human blood. The blood is treated to prevent the spread of diseases, such as hepatitis. With the current methods of screening and treating donated blood, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small. To further reduce the risk, you or your child can take clotting factor concentrates that aren't made from human blood. These are called recombinant clotting factors. Clotting factors are easy to store, mix, and use at home\u2014it only takes about 15 minutes to receive the factor. You may have replacement therapy on a regular basis to prevent bleeding. This is called preventive or prophylactic (PRO-fih-lac-tik) therapy. Or, you may only need replacement therapy to stop bleeding when it occurs. This use of the treatment, on an as-needed basis, is called demand therapy. Demand therapy is less intensive and expensive than preventive therapy. However, there's a risk that bleeding will cause damage before you receive the demand therapy. Complications of Replacement Therapy Complications of replacement therapy include: Developing antibodies (proteins) that attack the clotting factor Developing viral infections from human clotting factors Damage to joints, muscles, or other parts of the body resulting from delays in treatment Antibodies to the clotting factor. Antibodies can destroy the clotting factor before it has a chance to work. This is a very serious problem. It prevents the main treatment for hemophilia (replacement therapy) from working. These antibodies, also called inhibitors, develop in about 20\u201330 percent of people who have severe hemophilia A. Inhibitors develop in 2\u20135 percent of people who have hemophilia B. When antibodies develop, doctors may use larger doses of clotting factor or try different clotting factor sources. Sometimes the antibodies go away. Researchers are studying new ways to deal with antibodies to clotting factors. Viruses from human clotting factors. Clotting factors made from human blood can carry the viruses that cause HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. However, the risk of getting an infectious disease from human clotting factors is very small due to: Careful screening of blood donors Testing of donated blood products Treating donated blood products with a detergent and heat to destroy viruses Vaccinating people who have hemophilia for hepatitis A and B Damage to joints, muscles, and other parts of the body. Delays in treatment can cause damage such as: \u00a0 Bleeding into a joint. If this happens many times, it can lead to changes in the shape of the joint and impair the joint's function. Swelling of the membrane around a joint. Pain, swelling, and redness of a joint. Pressure on a joint from swelling, which can destroy the joint. Home Treatment With Replacement Therapy You can do both preventive (ongoing) and demand (as-needed) replacement therapy at home. Many people learn to do the infusions at home for their child or for themselves. Home treatment has several advantages: You or your child can get quicker treatment when bleeding happens. Early treatment lowers the risk of complications. Fewer visits to the doctor or emergency room are needed. Home treatment costs less than treatment in a medical care setting. Home treatment helps children accept treatment and take responsibility for their own health. Discuss options for home treatment with your doctor or your child's doctor. A doctor or other health care provider can teach you the steps and safety procedures for home treatment. Hemophilia treatment centers are another good resource for learning about home treatment (discussed in \"Living With Hemophilia\u201d). Doctors can surgically implant vein access devices to make it easier for you to access a vein for treatment with replacement therapy. These devices can be helpful if treatment occurs often. However, infections can be a problem with these devices. Your doctor can help you decide whether this type of device is right for you or your child. Other Types of Treatment Desmopressin Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a man-made hormone used to treat people who have mild hemophilia A. DDAVP isn't used to treat hemophilia B or severe hemophilia A. DDAVP stimulates the release of stored factor VIII and von Willebrand factor; it also increases the level of these proteins in your blood. Von Willebrand factor carries and binds factor VIII, which can then stay in the bloodstream longer. DDAVP usually is given by injection or as nasal spray. Because the effect of this medicine wears off if it's used often, the medicine is given only in certain situations. For example, you may take this medicine prior to dental work or before playing certain sports to prevent or reduce bleeding. Antifibrinolytic Medicines Antifibrinolytic medicines (including tranexamic acid and epsilon aminocaproic acid) may be used with replacement therapy. They're usually given as a pill, and they help keep blood clots from breaking down. These medicines most often are used before dental work or to treat bleeding from the mouth or nose or mild intestinal bleeding. Gene Therapy Researchers are trying to find ways to correct the faulty genes that cause hemophilia. Gene therapy hasn't yet developed to the point that it's an accepted treatment for hemophilia. However, researchers continue to test gene therapy in clinical trials. For more information, go to the \"Clinical Trials\" section of this article. Treatment of a Specific Bleeding Site Pain medicines, steroids, and physical therapy may be used to reduce pain and swelling in an affected joint. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take. Which Treatment Is Best for You? The type of treatment you or your child receives depends on several things, including how severe the hemophilia is, the activities you'll be doing, and the dental or medical procedures you'll be having. Mild hemophilia\u2014Replacement therapy usually isn't needed for mild hemophilia. Sometimes, though, DDAVP is given to raise the body's level of factor VIII. Moderate hemophilia\u2014You may need replacement therapy only when bleeding occurs or to prevent bleeding that could occur when doing certain activities. Your doctor also may recommend DDAVP prior to having a procedure or doing an activity that increases the risk of bleeding. Severe hemophilia\u2014You usually need replacement therapy to prevent bleeding that could damage your joints, muscles, or other parts of your body. Typically, replacement therapy is given at home two or three times a week. This preventive therapy usually is started in patients at a young age and may need to continue for life. For both types of hemophilia, getting quick treatment for bleeding is important. Quick treatment can limit damage to your body. If you or your child has hemophilia, learn to recognize signs of bleeding. Other family members also should learn to watch for signs of bleeding in a child who has hemophilia. Children sometimes ignore signs of bleeding because they want to avoid the discomfort of treatment. If you or your child has hemophilia, you can take steps to prevent bleeding problems. Thanks to improvements in treatment, a child who has hemophilia today is likely to live a normal lifespan. Hemophilia Treatment Centers The Federal Government funds a nationwide network of hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs). These centers are an important resource for people who have hemophilia and their families. The medical experts at HTCs provide treatment, education, and support. They can teach you or your family members how to do home treatments. Center staff also can provide your doctor with information. People who get care at HTCs are less likely than those who get care elsewhere to have bleeding complications and hospitalizations. They're also more likely to have a better quality of life. This may be due to the centers' emphasis on bleeding prevention and the education and support provided to patients and their caregivers. More than 100 federally funded HTCs are located throughout the United States. Many HTCs are located at major university medical and research centers. The hemophilia teams at these centers include: Nurse coordinators Pediatricians (doctors who treat children) and adult and pediatric hematologists (doctors who specialize in blood disorders) Social workers (who can help with financial issues, transportation, mental health, and other issues) Physical therapists and orthopedists (doctors who specialize in disorders of the bones and joints) Dentists To find an HTC located near you, go to the directory of HTCs on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web site. Many people who have hemophilia go to HTCs for annual checkups, even if it means traveling some distance to do so. At an HTC, you or your child may be able to take part in clinical research and benefit from the latest hemophilia research findings. The HTC team also will work with your local health care providers to help meet your needs or your child's needs. Ongoing Care If you have hemophilia, you can take steps to avoid complications. For example: Follow your treatment plan exactly as your doctor prescribes. Have regular checkups and vaccinations as recommended. Tell all of your health care providers\u2014such as your doctor, dentist, and pharmacist\u2014that you have hemophilia. You also may want to tell people like your employee health nurse, gym trainer, and sports coach about your condition. Have regular dental care. Dentists at the HTCs are experts in providing dental care for people who have hemophilia. If you see another dentist, tell him or her that you have hemophilia. The dentist can provide medicine that will reduce bleeding during dental work. Know the signs and symptoms of bleeding in joints and other parts of the body. Know when to call your doctor or go to the emergency room. For example, you'll need care if you have: - Heavy bleeding that can't be stopped or a wound that continues to ooze blood. - Any signs or symptoms of bleeding in the brain. Such bleeding is life threatening and requires emergency care. - Limited motion, pain, or swelling of any joint. Heavy bleeding that can't be stopped or a wound that continues to ooze blood. Any signs or symptoms of bleeding in the brain. Such bleeding is life threatening and requires emergency care. Limited motion, pain, or swelling of any joint. It's a good idea to keep a record of all previous treatments. Be sure to take this information with you to medical appointments and to the hospital or emergency room. If Your Child Is Diagnosed With Hemophilia You may have emotional, financial, social, or other strains as you adjust to having a child who has hemophilia. Learn all you can about the disorder and get the support you need. Talk with doctors and other health care providers about treatment, prevention of bleeding, and what to do during an emergency. The care teams at HTCs can provide your child with treatment and help educate and support you. The social worker on the team can help with emotional issues, financial and transportation problems, and other concerns. Seek the many resources available through the Web, books, and other materials, including those provided by national and local hemophilia organizations. Look into support groups that offer a variety of activities for children who have hemophilia and for family members. Some groups offer summer camps for children who have hemophilia. Ask your doctor, nurse coordinator, or social worker about these groups and camps. Challenges will occur as your child grows and becomes more active. In addition to treatment and regular health and dental care, your child needs information about hemophilia that he or she can understand. Children who have hemophilia also need ongoing support, and they need to be reassured that the condition isn't their fault. Young children who have hemophilia need extra protection from things in the home and elsewhere that could cause injuries and bleeding: Protect toddlers with kneepads, elbow pads, and protective helmets. All children should wear safety helmets when riding tricycles or bicycles. Be sure to use the safety belts and straps in highchairs, car seats, and strollers to protect your child from falls. Remove furniture with sharp corners or pad them while your child is a toddler. Keep out of reach or locked away small and sharp objects and other items that could cause bleeding or harm. Check play equipment and outdoor play areas for possible hazards. You also should learn how to examine your child for and recognize signs of bleeding. Learn to prepare for bleeding episodes when they occur. Keep a cold pack in the freezer ready to use as directed or to take along with you to treat bumps and bruises. Popsicles work fine when there is minor bleeding in the mouth. You also might want to keep a bag ready to go with items you'll need if you must take your child to the emergency room or elsewhere. Be sure that anyone who is responsible for your child knows that he or she has hemophilia. Talk with your child's babysitters, daycare providers, teachers, other school staff, and coaches or leaders of afterschool activities about when to contact you or to call 9\u20131\u20131 for emergency care. Your child should wear a medical ID bracelet or necklace. If your child is injured, the ID will alert anyone caring for your child about his or her hemophilia. Physical Activity and Hemophilia Physical activity helps keep muscles flexible, strengthens joints, and helps maintain a healthy weight. Children and adults who have hemophilia should be physically active, but they may have limits on what they can do safely. People who have mild hemophilia can take part in many activities. Those who have severe hemophilia should avoid contact sports and other activities that are likely to lead to injuries that could cause bleeding. Examples of these activities include football, hockey, and wrestling. Physical therapists at HTCs can develop exercise programs tailored to your needs and teach you how to exercise safely. Talk with your doctor or physical therapist about recommended types of physical activity and sports. In general, some safe physical activities are swimming, biking (wearing a helmet), walking, and golf. To prevent bleeding, you also may be able to take clotting factors prior to exercise or a sporting event. Medicine Precautions Some medicines increase the risk of bleeding, such as: Aspirin and other medicines that contain salicylates (sa-LIH-sil-ates) Ibuprofen, naproxen, and some other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines Talk with your doctor or pharmacist about which medicines are safe for you to take. Treatment at Home and When Traveling Home treatment with replacement therapy has many benefits. It lets you treat bleeding early, before complications are likely to develop. Home treatment also can prevent frequent trips to the doctor's office or hospital. This can give you more independence and control over your hemophilia. However, if you're treating yourself or your child with clotting factors at home, you should take some steps for safety: Follow instructions for storage, preparation, and use of clotting factors and treatment materials. Keep a record of all medical treatment. Know the signs and symptoms of bleeding, infection, or an allergic reaction, and know the correct way to respond. Have someone with you when you treat yourself. Know when to call the doctor or 9\u20131\u20131. When you're traveling, be sure to take enough treatment supplies along. You also should carry a letter from your doctor describing your hemophilia and treatment. It's a good idea to find out in advance where to go for care when out of town. Cost Issues Clotting factors are very costly. Many health insurance companies will only pay for clotting factors on a case-by-case basis. It's important to know: What your insurance covers Whether your insurance has a limit on the dollar amount it will cover and what that amount is Whether restrictions or waiting periods apply As children grow, it's important to learn about available options for insurance. Look into what kinds of health insurance are offered when seeking a job."

        "document": "Hemophilia A (Treatment): People with inherited hemophilia A require life-long care, preferably through a specialized hemophilia treatment center. Although there is no cure for hemophilia A, current treatments usually work well. Treatment primarily consists of replacing the missing clotting factor VIII ( replacement therapy) and preventing complications that are associated with the disorder. The type and frequency of treatment often depends on the severity of the disorder in each person. People with mild or moderate hemophilia A may be treated with replacement therapy as needed (for example, when a specific bleeding episode occurs). This is called episodic therapy. Some people with mild hemophilia A may be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP). Desmopressin raises the levels of factor VIII in the blood and may be taken intravenously or through a nasal spray. Drugs known as antifibrinolytics, which slow the breakdown of clotting factors in the blood, can also be used to treat those with a mild form of the disorder. Some people with severe hemophilia A may receive periodic factor VIII infusions to prevent bleeding episodes and associated complications such as joint damage. This is referred to as prophylactic therapy. People can be trained to give infusions at home. This is especially important for people with severe disease because the infusion works the best within one hour of a bleeding episode. In general, rapid treatment is important because it reduces pain and damage to the joints, muscles or other affected tissues or organs .

How much you get depends on:      - Severity of bleeding   - Site of bleeding   - Your weight and height      Mild hemophilia may be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP). This medicine helps the body release factor VIII that is stored within the lining of blood vessels.   To prevent a bleeding crisis, people with hemophilia and their families can be taught to give factor VIII concentrates at home at the first signs of bleeding. People with severe forms of the disease may need regular preventive treatment.   DDAVP or factor VIII concentrate may also be needed before having dental extractions or surgery.   You should get the hepatitis B vaccine. People with hemophilia are more likely to get hepatitis B because they may receive blood products.   Some people with hemophilia A develop antibodies to factor VIII. These antibodies are called inhibitors. The inhibitors attack factor VIII so that it no longer works. In such cases, a man-made clotting factor called VIIa can be given."

        "document": "Klinefelter syndrome: Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a condition that occurs in males when they have an extra X chromosome . Some males with KS have no obvious signs or symptoms while others may have varying degrees of cognitive, social, behavioral, and learning difficulties. Adults with Klinefelter syndrome may also experience primary hypogonadism (decreased testosterone production), small testes , enlarged breast tissue ( gynecomastia ), tall stature, and/or infertility. KS is not inherited , but usually occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm). Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. [1] [2] [3] The signs and symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome (KS) vary among affected people. Some men with KS have no symptoms of the condition or are only mildy affected. In these cases, they may not even know that they are affected by KS. When present, symptoms may include: [1] [2] [3] Small, firm testicles Delayed or incomplete puberty Breast growth ( gynecomastia ) Reduced facial and body hair Infertility Tall height Abnormal body proportions (long legs, short trunk, shoulder equal to hip size) Learning disablity Speech delay Whether or not a male with KS has visible symptoms depends on many factors, including how much testosterone his body makes, if he is mosaic (with both XY and XXY cells ), and his age when the condition is diagnosed and treated. [1] Klinefelter syndrome usually occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm). An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes . For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain one or more extra copies of the X chromosome as a result of nondisjunction. If one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have one or more extra X chromosomes in each of the body's cells. [2] Most often, Klinefelter syndrome is caused by a single extra copy of the X chromosome, resulting in a total of 47 chromosomes per cell. Males normally have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell (46, XY), while females have two X chromosomes (46, XX). People with Klinefelter syndrome usually have two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome (47, XXY). Some people with Klinefelter syndrome have the extra X chromosome in only some of their cells; these people are said to have mosaic\u00a0Klinefelter syndrome. [2] It is estimated that about half of the time, the cell division error occurs during development of the sperm, while the remainder are due to errors in egg development. Women who have pregnancies after age 35 have a slightly increased chance of having offspring with this syndrome. [4] The features of Klinefelter syndrome are due to the extra copies of genes on the extra X chromosome, which can alter male sexual development. [3] Klinefelter syndrome \u00a0is not inherited , but usually occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm). An error in cell division called nondisjunction can result in reproductive cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes . For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain one or more extra copies of the X chromosome as a result of nondisjunction. If one of these reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have one or several extra X chromosomes in each of the body's cells. [2] A diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. Additional testing can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. This generally includes a chromosomal analysis (called a karyotype ). [3] [5]\u00a0 It is also possible to diagnosis Klinefelter syndrome before birth through chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis . [5] Because symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome (KS) can sometimes be very mild, many people are never diagnosed or treated. When a diagnosis is made, treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. This may include: [1] [3] [6] Educational interventions - As children, many people with Klinefelter syndrome qualify for special services to help them in school. Teachers can also help by using certain methods in the classroom, such as breaking bigger tasks into small steps. Therapeutic options - A variety of therapists, such as physical, speech, occupational, behavioral, mental health, and family therapists can often help reduce or eliminate some of the symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome such as poor muscle tone; speech and language problems; or low self-confidence. Medical management - About half of people with KS have low testosterone levels, which may be raised by taking supplemental testosterone. Having a more normal testosterone level can help affected people develop bigger muscles, a deeper voice, and facial and body hair. Many healthcare providers recommend testosterone therapy when a boy reaches puberty. However, not all males with KS benefit from testosterone therapy. Some affected people may opt to have breast removal or reduction surgery. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Web site offers more specific information on the treatment and management of Klinefelter syndrome. Please click on the link to access this resource. Babies with the 47, XXY form of Klinefelter differ little from healthy children. The results of one study on non- mosaic XXY infants younger than 2 years indicated that most XXY babies had normal external genitalia and facial features with height and weight in the normal range. Genetic testing had been performed due to a delay in walking and/or speech. Early detection of Klinefelter syndrome is shown to be important to monitor potential developmental problems. [6] Boys with the 47, XXY karyotype may struggle through adolescence with academics,\u00a0various frustrations, and, in a few instances, serious emotional or behavioral difficulties. However, most move toward full independence from their families as they enter adulthood. Some have completed graduate education and have a normal level of functioning.\u00a0 Lifespan is not affected by Klinefelter syndrome. [6] It is estimated that 1 in every 500 to 1,000 newborn males has an extra X chromosome, making Klinefelter syndrome one of the most common chromosomal disorders seen among newborns. Variants of Klinefelter syndrome (such as 48,XXXY, 49,XXXXY) are much rarer, occurring in 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 85,000 or fewer newborns. [1] [7] It is suspected that Klinefelter syndrome is underdiagnosed because mild cases may not be identified. In addition, the features of this condition vary and can overlap significantly with those of other conditions. [7] The following diseases are related to Klinefelter syndrome.

CHD causes more deaths in the first year of life than any other birth defects.    Congenital heart disease is often divided into 2 types: cyanotic (blue skin color caused by a lack of oxygen) and non-cyanotic. The following lists cover the most common congenital heart diseases:   Cyanotic:     - Ebstein's anomaly   - Hypoplastic left heart   - Pulmonary atresia   - Tetralogy of Fallot   - Total anomalous pulmonary venous return   - Transposition of the great vessels   - Tricuspid atresia   - Truncus arteriosus     Non-cyanotic:     - Aortic stenosis   - Atrial septal defect (ASD)   - Atrioventricular canal (endocardial cushion defect)   - Coarctation of the aorta   - Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)   - Pulmonic stenosis   - Ventricular septal defect (VSD)      These problems may occur alone or together. Most children with CHD do not have other types of birth defects. However, heart defects may be part of genetic and chromosomal syndromes. Some of these syndromes may be passed down through families.    Examples include:      - DiGeorge syndrome   - Down syndrome   - Marfan syndrome   - Noonan syndrome   - Trisomy 13   - Turner syndrome     Often, no cause for the heart disease can be found. Congenital heart diseases continue to be investigated and researched. Drugs such as retinoic acid for acne, chemicals, alcohol, and infections (such as rubella) during pregnancy can contribute to some congenital heart problems.   Poorly controlled blood sugar in women who have diabetes during pregnancy has also been linked to a high rate of congenital heart defects."

        "document": "critical congenital heart disease (Genetic Changes): In most cases, the cause of CCHD is unknown. A variety of genetic and environmental factors likely contribute to this complex condition.   Changes in single genes have been associated with CCHD. Studies suggest that these genes are involved in normal heart development before birth. Most of the identified mutations reduce the amount or function of the protein that is produced from a specific gene, which likely impairs the normal formation of structures in the heart. Studies have also suggested that having more or fewer copies of particular genes compared with other people, a phenomenon known as copy number variation, may play a role in CCHD. However, it is unclear whether genes affected by copy number variation are involved in heart development and how having missing or extra copies of those genes could lead to heart defects. Researchers believe that single-gene mutations and copy number variation account for a relatively small percentage of all CCHD.   CCHD is usually isolated, which means it occurs alone (without signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body). However, the heart defects associated with CCHD can also occur as part of genetic syndromes that have additional features. Some of these genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, result from changes in the number or structure of particular chromosomes. Other conditions, including Noonan syndrome and Alagille syndrome, result from mutations in single genes.   Environmental factors may also contribute to the development of CCHD. Potential risk factors that have been studied include exposure to certain chemicals or drugs before birth, viral infections (such as rubella and influenza) that occur during pregnancy, and other maternal illnesses including diabetes and phenylketonuria. Although researchers are examining risk factors that may be associated with this complex condition, many of these factors remain unknown."

The extra material affects normal development. Symptoms may include:     - Clenched hands   - Crossed legs   - Feet with a rounded bottom (rocker-bottom feet)   - Low birth weight   - Low-set ears   - Mental delay   - Poorly developed fingernails   - Small head (microcephaly)   - Small jaw (micrognathia)   - Undescended testicle   - Unusual shaped chest (pectus carinatum) An exam during pregnancy may show an unusually large uterus and extra amniotic fluid. There may be an unusually small placenta when the baby is born. A physical exam of the infant may show unusual fingerprint patterns. X-rays may show a short breast bone.    Chromosome studies will show trisomy 18. The chromosome abnormality may be present in every cell or present in only a certain percentage of the cells (called mosaicism). Studies may also show part of the chromosome in some cells. Rarely, part of the chromosome 18 becomes attached to another chromosome. This is called translocation.

Your blood pressure may drop for a short while. This might cause the baby's heart rate to slow down.     - To avoid this, you will receive fluids through an intravenous (IV) line to help keep your blood pressure stable.   - If your blood pressure shows a drop, you may need to lie on your side to keep the blood moving throughout your body.   - Your provider may also give you medicine to raise your blood pressure.     An epidural block may change or alter labor and delivery.     - If you are very numb from the block, you may have a harder time bearing down to push your baby through the birth canal.   - Contractions may lessen or slow down for a little while, but labor will still move along as it should. In some cases, it may even go faster. If your labor slows down, your doctor can give you medicine to speed up your contractions. It is best to wait until you are in active labor to have the epidural placed.     Other rare side effects are:     - You may get a headache after your epidural but this is rare.   - Medicine could enter your spinal fluid.

        "document": "Spinal and epidural anesthesia: Spinal and epidural anesthesia are medicines that numb parts of your body to block pain. They are given through shots in or around the spine. The doctor who gives you epidural or spinal anesthesia is called an anesthesiologist.   First, the area of your back where the needle is inserted is cleaned with a special solution. The area may also be numbed with a local anesthetic.   You'll likely receive fluids through an intravenous line (IV) in a vein. You may receive medicine through the IV to help you relax or sleep lightly.   For an epidural:     - The doctor injects medicine just outside of the sac of fluid around your spinal cord. This is called the epidural space.   - The medicine numbs, or blocks feeling in a certain part of your body so that you cannot feel pain. The medicine begins to take effect in about 10 to 20 minutes. It works well for longer procedures. Women often have an epidural during childbirth.   - A small tube (catheter) is often left in place. You can receive more medicine through the catheter to help control your pain during or after your procedure.     For a spinal:     - The doctor injects medicine into the fluid in your spinal cord. This is usually done only once, so you will not need to have a catheter placed.   - The medicine begins to take effect right away. It works well for shorter and simpler procedures.     Your pulse, blood pressure and oxygen level in your blood are checked during the procedure. After the procedure, you will have a bandage where the needle was inserted. Spinal and epidural anesthesia have fewer side effects and risks than general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free). People usually recover their senses much faster. Sometimes, they have to wait for the anesthetic to wear off so they can walk.   Spinal anesthesia is often used for genital, urinary tract, or lower body procedures.   Epidural anesthesia is often used during labor and delivery, and surgery in the pelvis and legs.   Epidural and spinal anesthesia are often used when:     - The procedure or labor is too painful without any pain medicine.   - The procedure is in the belly, legs, or feet.   - Your body can remain in a comfortable position during your procedure.   - You want fewer systemic side effects and a shorter recovery than you would have from general anesthesia. Spinal and epidural anesthesia are generally safe. Ask your doctor about these possible complications:     - Allergic reaction to the anesthesia used   - Bleeding around the spinal column (hematoma)   - Difficulty urinating   - Drop in blood pressure   - Infection in your spine (meningitis or abscess)   - Nerve damage   - Seizures (this is rare)   - Severe headache Tell your health care provider:     - If you are or could be pregnant   - What medicines you are taking, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription     During the days before the procedure:     - Tell your doctor about any allergies or health conditions you have, what medicines you are taking, and what anesthesia or sedation you have had before.   - If your procedure is planned, you may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other blood thinners.   - Ask your doctor which medicines you should still take on the day of your procedure.   - Arrange for a responsible adult to drive you to and from the hospital or clinic.   - If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your provider for help quitting.     On the day of the procedure:     - Follow instructions on when to stop eating and drinking.   - Do not drink alcohol the night before and the day of your procedure.   - Take the medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water.   - Follow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time. After an epidural, the catheter in your back is removed. You lie in bed until you have feeling in your legs and can walk. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired.   After spinal anesthesia, you lie flat in bed for a few hours. This is to keep you from getting a headache. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired. Most people feel no pain during spinal and epidural anesthesia and recover fully. Updated by: Jennifer Sobol, DO, urologist with the Michigan Institute of Urology, West Bloomfield, MI.

The numbing medicine is given through the tube for as long as it is needed.   In most cases, you will receive a low dose because it is safer for you and baby. Once the medicine takes effect (10 to 20 minutes), you should feel better. You may still feel some back or rectal pressure during contractions.   You may shiver after an epidural, but this is common. Many women shiver during labor even without an epidural. Many studies have shown that an epidural is a safe way to manage pain during childbirth. While rare, there are some risks.   Your blood pressure may drop for a short while. This might cause the baby's heart rate to slow down.     - To avoid this, you will receive fluids through an intravenous (IV) line to help keep your blood pressure stable.   - If your blood pressure shows a drop, you may need to lie on your side to keep the blood moving throughout your body.   - Your provider may also give you medicine to raise your blood pressure.     An epidural block may change or alter labor and delivery.     - If you are very numb from the block, you may have a harder time bearing down to push your baby through the birth canal.   - Contractions may lessen or slow down for a little while, but labor will still move along as it should. In some cases, it may even go faster. If your labor slows down, your doctor can give you medicine to speed up your contractions. It is best to wait until you are in active labor to have the epidural placed.     Other rare side effects are:     - You may get a headache after your epidural but this is rare.   - Medicine could enter your spinal fluid. For a short while, it could make you feel dizzy, or you might have a hard time breathing. You could also have a seizure. This is also rare. There are 2 types:     - \"Walking\" epidural block. This type of epidural will lessen your pain, but you will still be able to move your legs. Most women are not really able to walk around, but they can move their legs.   - Combined spinal epidural block. This combines both a spinal and epidural block. It provides pain relief much faster. The combined block is used when women are in very active labor and want relief right away. Updated by: Laura J.

        "document": "What is Epilepsy?: The epilepsies are a spectrum of brain disorders ranging from severe, life-threatening and disabling, to ones that are much more benign. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. The epilepsies have many possible causes and there are several types of seizures. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activityfrom illness to brain damage to abnormal brain developmentcan lead to seizures. Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, changes in important features of brain cells called channels, or some combination of these and other factors. Having a single seizure as the result of a high fever (called febrile seizure) or head injury does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. A measurement of electrical activity in the brain and brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy."

        "document": "Epilepsy (Diagnosis): To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose epilepsy and determine the cause of seizures. Your evaluation may include: - A neurological exam. Your doctor may test your behavior, motor abilities, mental function and other areas to diagnose your condition and determine the type of epilepsy you may have. - Blood tests. Your doctor may take a blood sample to check for signs of infections, genetic conditions or other conditions that may be associated with seizures. Your doctor may also suggest tests to detect brain abnormalities, such as: - Electroencephalogram (EEG). This is the most common test used to diagnose epilepsy. In this test, doctors attach electrodes to your scalp with a paste-like substance. The electrodes record the electrical activity of your brain. If you have epilepsy, it's common to have changes in your normal pattern of brain waves, even when you're not having a seizure. Your doctor may monitor you on video while conducting an EEG while you're awake or asleep, to record any seizures you experience. Recording the seizures may help the doctor determine what kind of seizures you're having or rule out other conditions. Your doctor may give you instructions to do something that will cause seizures, such as getting little sleep prior to the test. - High-density EEG. In a variation of an EEG test, your doctor may recommend high-density EEG, which spaces electrodes more closely than conventional EEG - about a half a centimeter apart. High-density EEG may help your doctor more precisely determine which areas of your brain are affected by seizures. - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can reveal abnormalities in your brain that might be causing your seizures, such as tumors, bleeding and cysts. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of your brain. Your doctor may be able to detect lesions or abnormalities in your brain that could be causing your seizures. - Functional MRI (fMRI). A functional MRI measures the changes in blood flow that occur when specific parts of your brain are working. Doctors may use an fMRI before surgery to identify the exact locations of critical functions, such as speech and movement, so that surgeons can avoid injuring those places while operating. - Positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein to help visualize active areas of the brain and detect abnormalities. - Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). This type of test is used primarily if you've had an MRI and EEG that didn't pinpoint the location in your brain where the seizures are originating. A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein to create a detailed, 3-D map of the blood flow activity in your brain during seizures. Doctors also may conduct a form of a SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM), which may provide even more-detailed results. - Neuropsychological tests. In these tests, doctors assess your thinking, memory and speech skills. The test results help doctors determine which areas of your brain are affected. Along with your test results, your doctor may use a combination of analysis techniques to help pinpoint where in the brain seizures start: - Statistical parametric mapping (SPM). SPM is a method of comparing areas of the brain that have increased metabolism during seizures to normal brains, which can give doctors an idea of where seizures begin. - Curry analysis. Curry analysis is a technique that takes EEG data and projects it onto an MRI of the brain to show doctors where seizures are occurring. - Magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG measures the magnetic fields produced by brain activity to identify potential areas of seizure onset. Accurate diagnosis of your seizure type and where seizures begin gives you the best chance for finding an effective treatment."

        "document": "Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness. Anyone can develop epilepsy. Epilepsy affects both males and females of all races, ethnic backgrounds and ages. Seizure symptoms can vary widely. Some people with epilepsy simply stare blankly for a few seconds during a seizure, while others repeatedly twitch their arms or legs. Having a single seizure doesn't mean you have epilepsy. At least two unprovoked seizures are generally required for an epilepsy diagnosis. Treatment with medications or sometimes surgery can control seizures for the majority of people with epilepsy. Some people require lifelong treatment to control seizures, but for others, the seizures eventually go away. Some children with epilepsy may outgrow the condition with age. Epilepsy care at Mayo Clinic Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: - Temporary confusion   - A staring spell   - Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs   - Loss of consciousness or awareness   - Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal (partial) seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: - Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights.   - Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. During a complex partial seizure, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. - Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness.   - Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground.   - Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down.   - Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms.   - Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs.   - Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. When to see a doctor Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: - The seizure lasts more than five minutes.   - Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops.   - A second seizure follows immediately.   - You have a high fever.   - You're experiencing heat exhaustion.   - You're pregnant.   - You have diabetes.   - You've injured yourself during the seizure. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice. Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including: -  Genetic influence. Some types of epilepsy, which are categorized by the type of seizure you experience or the part of the brain that is affected, run in families. In these cases, it's likely that there's a genetic influence.  Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes, but for most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures.    - Head trauma. Head trauma as a result of a car accident or other traumatic injury can cause epilepsy.   - Brain conditions. Brain conditions that cause damage to the brain, such as brain tumors or strokes, can cause epilepsy. Stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy in adults older than age 35.   - Infectious diseases. Infectious diseases, such as meningitis, AIDS and viral encephalitis, can cause epilepsy.   - Prenatal injury. Before birth, babies are sensitive to brain damage that could be caused by several factors, such as an infection in the mother, poor nutrition or oxygen deficiencies. This brain damage can result in epilepsy or cerebral palsy.   - Developmental disorders. Epilepsy can sometimes be associated with developmental disorders, such as autism and neurofibromatosis. Certain factors may increase your risk of epilepsy: - Age. The onset of epilepsy is most common in children and older adults, but the condition can occur at any age.   - Family history. If you have a family history of epilepsy, you may be at an increased risk of developing a seizure disorder.   - Head injuries. Head injuries are responsible for some cases of epilepsy. You can reduce your risk by wearing a seat belt while riding in a car and by wearing a helmet while bicycling, skiing, riding a motorcycle or engaging in other activities with a high risk of head injury.   - Stroke and other vascular diseases. Stroke and other blood vessel (vascular) diseases can lead to brain damage that may trigger epilepsy. You can take a number of steps to reduce your risk of these diseases, including limiting your intake of alcohol and avoiding cigarettes, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.   - Dementia. Dementia can increase the risk of epilepsy in older adults.   - Brain infections. Infections such as meningitis, which causes inflammation in your brain or spinal cord, can increase your risk.   - Seizures in childhood. High fevers in childhood can sometimes be associated with seizures. Children who have seizures due to high fevers generally won't develop epilepsy. The risk of epilepsy increases if a child has a long seizure, another nervous system condition or a family history of epilepsy. To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose epilepsy and determine the cause of seizures.

MEG measures the magnetic fields produced by brain activity to identify potential areas of seizure onset. Accurate diagnosis of your seizure type and where seizures begin gives you the best chance for finding an effective treatment. Doctors generally begin by treating epilepsy with medication. If medications don't treat the condition, doctors may propose surgery or another type of treatment. Medication Most people with epilepsy can become seizure-free by taking one anti-seizure medication, which is also called anti-epileptic medication. Others may be able to decrease the frequency and intensity of their seizures by taking a combination of medications. Many children with epilepsy who aren't experiencing epilepsy symptoms can eventually discontinue medications and live a seizure-free life. Many adults can discontinue medications after two or more years without seizures. Your doctor will advise you about the appropriate time to stop taking medications. Finding the right medication and dosage can be complex. Your doctor will consider your condition, frequency of seizures, your age and other factors when choosing which medication to prescribe. Your doctor will also review any other medications you may be taking, to ensure the anti-epileptic medications won't interact with them. Your doctor likely will first prescribe a single medication at a relatively low dosage and may increase the dosage gradually until your seizures are well-controlled. Anti-seizure medications may have some side effects. Mild side effects include: - Fatigue - Dizziness - Weight gain - Loss of bone density - Skin rashes - Loss of coordination - Speech problems - Memory and thinking problems More-severe but rare side effects include: - Depression - Suicidal thoughts and behaviors - Severe rash - Inflammation of certain organs, such as your liver To achieve the best seizure control possible with medication, follow these steps: - Take medications exactly as prescribed. - Always call your doctor before switching to a generic version of your medication or taking other prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs or herbal remedies. - Never stop taking your medication without talking to your doctor. - Notify your doctor immediately if you notice new or increased feelings of depression, suicidal thoughts, or unusual changes in your mood or behaviors. - Tell your doctor if you have migraines. Doctors may prescribe one of the anti-epileptic medications that can prevent your migraines and treat epilepsy. At least half the people newly diagnosed with epilepsy will become seizure-free with their first medication. If anti-epileptic medications don't provide satisfactory results, your doctor may suggest surgery or other therapies. You'll have regular follow-up appointments with your doctor to evaluate your condition and medications. Surgery When medications fail to provide adequate control over seizures, surgery may be an option. With epilepsy surgery, a surgeon removes the area of your brain that's causing seizures. Doctors usually perform surgery when tests show that: - Your seizures originate in a small, well-defined area of your brain - The area in your brain to be operated on doesn't interfere with vital functions such as speech, language, motor function, vision or hearing Although many people continue to need some medication to help prevent seizures after successful surgery, you may be able to take fewer drugs and reduce your dosages. In a small number of cases, surgery for epilepsy can cause complications such as permanently altering your thinking (cognitive) abilities. Talk to your surgeon about his or her experience, success rates, and complication rates with the procedure you're considering. Therapies Apart from medications and surgery, these potential therapies offer an alternative for treating epilepsy: - Vagus nerve stimulation. In vagus nerve stimulation, doctors implant a device called a vagus nerve stimulator underneath the skin of your chest, similar to a heart pacemaker. Wires from the stimulator are connected to the vagus nerve in your neck. The battery-powered device sends bursts of electrical energy through the vagus nerve and to your brain. It's not clear how this inhibits seizures, but the device can usually reduce seizures by 20 to 40 percent. Most people still need to take anti-epileptic medication, although some people may be able to lower their medication dose. You may experience side effects from vagus nerve stimulation, such as throat pain, hoarse voice, shortness of breath or coughing. - Ketogenic diet. Some children with epilepsy have been able to reduce their seizures by following a strict diet that's high in fats and low in carbohydrates. In this diet, called a ketogenic diet, the body breaks down fats instead of carbohydrates for energy. After a few years, some children may be able to stop the ketogenic diet - under close supervision of their doctors - and remain seizure-free. Consult a doctor if you or your child is considering a ketogenic diet. It's important to make sure that your child doesn't become malnourished when following the diet. Side effects of a ketogenic diet may include dehydration, constipation, slowed growth because of nutritional deficiencies and a buildup of uric acid in the blood, which can cause kidney stones. These side effects are uncommon if the diet is properly and medically supervised. Following a ketogenic diet can be a challenge. Low-glycemic index and modified Atkins diets offer less restrictive alternatives that may still provide some benefit for seizure control. Potential future treatments Researchers are studying many potential new treatments for epilepsy, including: - Deep brain stimulation. In deep brain stimulation, surgeons implant electrodes into a specific part of your brain, typically your thalamus. The electrodes are connected to a generator implanted in your chest or the skull that sends electrical pulses to your brain and may reduce your seizures. - Responsive neurostimulation. Implantable, pacemaker-like devices that help prevent seizures are also under investigation. These responsive stimulation or closed loop devices analyze brain activity patterns to detect seizures before they happen and deliver an electrical charge or drug to stop the seizure. - Continuous stimulation of the seizure onset zone (subthreshold stimulation). Subthreshold stimulation - continuous stimulation to an area of your brain below a level that's physically noticeable - appears to improve seizure outcomes and quality of life for some people with seizures. This treatment approach may work in people who have seizures that start in an area of the brain that can't be removed because it would affect speech and motor functions (eloquent area). Or it might benefit people whose seizure characteristics mean their chances of successful treatment with responsive neurostimulation are low. - Minimally invasive surgery. New minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as MRI-guided laser ablation, show promise at reducing seizures with fewer risks than traditional open brain surgery for epilepsy. - Stereotactic laser ablation or radiosurgery. For some types of epilepsy, stereotactic laser ablation or stereotactic radiosurgery may provide effective treatment for people in which an open procedure may be too risky. In these procedures, doctors direct radiation at the specific area in the brain causing seizures, to destroy that tissue in an effort to better control the seizures. - External nerve stimulation device. Similar to vagus nerve stimulation, this device would stimulate specific nerves to reduce frequency of seizures. But unlike vagus nerve stimulation, this device would be worn externally so that no surgery to implant the device is needed. Understanding your condition can help you take better control of it: - Take your medication correctly. Don't adjust your dosage before talking to your doctor. If you feel your medication should be changed, discuss it with your doctor. - Get enough sleep. Lack of sleep can trigger seizures. Be sure to get adequate rest every night. - Wear a medical alert bracelet. This will help emergency personnel know how to treat you correctly. - Exercise. Exercising may help keep you physically healthy and reduce depression. Make sure to drink enough water, and rest if you get tired during exercise. In addition, make healthy life choices, such as managing stress, limiting alcoholic beverages and avoiding cigarettes."

        "document": "Ibuprofen: People who take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (other than aspirin) such as ibuprofen may have a higher risk of having a heart attack or a stroke than people who do not take these medications. These events may happen without warning and may cause death. This risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time. Do not take an NSAID such as ibuprofen if you have recently had a heart attack, unless directed to do so by your doctor. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had heart disease, a heart attack, or a stroke; if you smoke; and if you have or have ever had high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes. Get emergency medical help right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness in one part or side of the body, or slurred speech.   If you will be undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG; a type of heart surgery), you should not take ibuprofen right before or right after the surgery.   NSAIDs such as ibuprofen may cause ulcers, bleeding, or holes in the stomach or intestine. These problems may develop at any time during treatment, may happen without warning symptoms, and may cause death. The risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time, are older in age, have poor health, or who drink three or more alcoholic drinks per day while taking ibuprofen. Tell your doctor if you take any of the following medications: anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven); aspirin; other NSAIDs such as ketoprofen and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn); oral steroids such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), and prednisone (Rayos); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram (Celexa), fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem, Selfemra, in Symbyax), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Brisdelle, Paxil, Pexeva), and sertraline (Zoloft); or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as desvenlafaxine (Khedezla, Pristiq), duloxetine (Cymbalta), and venlafaxine (Effexor XR). Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had ulcers, bleeding in your stomach or intestines, or other bleeding disorders. If you experience any of the following symptoms, stop taking ibuprofen and call your doctor: stomach pain, heartburn, vomit that is bloody or looks like coffee grounds, blood in the stool, or black and tarry stools.   Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will monitor your symptoms carefully and will probably order certain tests to check your body's response to ibuprofen. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling so that your doctor can prescribe the right amount of medication to treat your condition with the lowest risk of serious side effects.   Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with prescription ibuprofen and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide. Prescription ibuprofen is used to relieve pain, tenderness, swelling, and stiffness caused by osteoarthritis (arthritis caused by a breakdown of the lining of the joints) and rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis caused by swelling of the lining of the joints). It is also used to relieve mild to moderate pain, including menstrual pain (pain that happens before or during a menstrual period). Nonprescription ibuprofen is used to reduce fever and to relieve minor aches and pain from headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, menstrual periods, the common cold, toothaches, and backaches. Ibuprofen is in a class of medications called NSAIDs. It works by stopping the body's production of a substance that causes pain, fever, and inflammation. Prescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken three or four times a day for arthritis or every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. Nonprescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet, chewable tablet, suspension (liquid), and drops (concentrated liquid). Adults and children older than 12 years of age may usually take nonprescription ibuprofen every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain or fever. Children and infants may usually be given nonprescription ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain or fever, but should not be given more than 4 doses in 24 hours. Ibuprofen may be taken with food or milk to prevent stomach upset. If you are taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, you should take it at the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ibuprofen exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor.   Ibuprofen comes alone and in combination with other medications. Some of these combination products are available by prescription only, and some of these combination products are available without a prescription and are used to treat cough and cold symptoms and other conditions. If your doctor has prescribed a medication that contains ibuprofen, you should be careful not to take any nonprescription medications that also contain ibuprofen.   If you are selecting a product to treat cough or cold symptoms, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for you. Check nonprescription product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child.   Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain ibuprofen, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 4 years of age. If you give these products to children 4 to 11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully.   If you are giving ibuprofen or a combination product that contains ibuprofen to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give ibuprofen products that are made for adults to children.   Before you give an ibuprofen product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Ask the child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give the child.   Shake the suspension and drops well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the measuring cup provided to measure each dose of the suspension, and use the dosing device provided to measure each dose of the drops.   The chewable tablets may cause a burning feeling in the mouth or throat. Take the chewable tablets with food or water.   Stop taking nonprescription ibuprofen and call your doctor if your symptoms get worse, you develop new or unexpected symptoms, the part of your body that was painful becomes red or swollen, your pain lasts for more than 10 days, or your fever lasts more than 3 days. Stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child does not start to feel better during the first 24 hours of treatment. Also stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child develops new symptoms, including redness or swelling on the painful part of his body, or if your child's pain or fever get worse or lasts longer than 3 days.   Do not give nonprescription ibuprofen to a child who has a sore throat that is severe or does not go away, or that comes along with fever, headache, nausea, or vomiting. Call the child's doctor right away, because these symptoms may be signs of a more serious condition. Ibuprofen is also sometimes used to treat ankylosing spondylitis (arthritis that mainly affects the spine), gouty arthritis (joint pain caused by a build-up of certain substances in the joints), and psoriatic arthritis (arthritis that occurs with a long-lasting skin disease that causes scaling and swelling). Talk to your doctor about the risks of using this drug for your condition.   This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. Before taking ibuprofen,     - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to ibuprofen, aspirin or other NSAIDs such as ketoprofen and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), any other medications, or any of the inactive ingredients in the type of ibuprofen you plan to take.

Some types of nonprescription ibuprofen may be sweetened with aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet. If you are taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Ibuprofen may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:      - constipation   - diarrhea   - gas or bloating   - dizziness   - nervousness   - ringing in the ears    Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of the following symptoms, or those mentioned in the IMPORTANT WARNING section, call your doctor immediately. Do not take any more ibuprofen until you speak to your doctor.      - unexplained weight gain   - shortness of breath or difficulty breathing   - swelling of the abdomen, feet, ankles, or lower legs   - fever   - blisters   - rash   - itching   - hives   - swelling of the eyes, face, throat, arms, or hands   - difficulty breathing or swallowing   - hoarseness   - excessive tiredness   - pain in the upper right part of the stomach   - nausea   - loss of appetite   - yellowing of the skin or eyes   - flu-like symptoms   - pale skin   - fast heartbeat   - cloudy, discolored, or bloody urine   - back pain   - difficult or painful urination   - blurred vision, changes in color vision, or other vision problems   - red or painful eyes   - stiff neck   - headache   - confusion   - aggression     Ibuprofen may cause other side effects.

        "document": "Oxazepam: Oxazepam may increase the risk of serious or life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma if used along with certain medications. Tell your doctor if you are taking or plan to take certain opiate medications for cough such as codeine (in Triacin-C, in Tuzistra XR) or hydrocodone (in Anexsia, in Norco, in Zyfrel) or for pain such as codeine (in Fiorinal), fentanyl (Actiq, Duragesic, Subsys, others), hydromorphone (Dilaudid, Exalgo), meperidine (Demerol), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), morphine (Astramorph, Duramorph PF, Kadian), oxycodone (in Oxycet, in Percocet, in Roxicet, others), and tramadol (Conzip, Ultram, in Ultracet). Your doctor may need to change the dosages of your medications and will monitor you carefully. If you take oxazepam with any of these medications and you develop any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care immediately: unusual dizziness, lightheadedness, extreme sleepiness, slowed or difficult breathing, or unresponsiveness. Be sure that your caregiver or family members know which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor or emergency medical care if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.   Drinking alcohol or using street drugs during your treatment with oxazepam also increases the risk that you will experience these serious, life-threatening side effects. Do not drink alcohol or use street drugs during your treatment. Oxazepam is used to relieve anxiety, including anxiety caused by alcohol withdrawal (symptoms that may develop in people who stop drinking alcohol after drinking large amounts for a long time). Oxazepam is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines. It works by slowing activity in the brain to allow for relaxation. Oxazepam comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken three or four times a day and may be taken with or without food. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take oxazepam exactly as directed.   Oxazepam can be habit-forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer time than prescribed by your doctor. Oxazepam may not work as well if it is taken for a long time.   Oxazepam may help control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to take oxazepam even if you feel well. Do not skip doses even if you feel that you do not need them. Do not stop taking this medication without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop taking oxazepam, you may experience withdrawal symptoms (anxiousness, sleeplessness, and irritability). Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. Oxazepam is also used to treat irritable bowel syndrome. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition.   This medication may be prescribed for other uses. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information. Before taking oxazepam,     - tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to oxazepam, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in oxazepam capsules. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.   - tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Be sure to mention any of the following: antihistamines; digoxin (Lanoxin); levodopa (in Ritary, in Sinemet, in Stalevo); medication for depression, seizures, Parkinson's disease, asthma, colds, or allergies; muscle relaxants; oral contraceptives; phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek); probenecid (Probalan, in Col-Probenecid); rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane, in Rifamate, in Rifater); sedatives; sleeping pills; theophylline (Elixophyllin, Theo 24, Theochron); or tranquilizers. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.   - tell your doctor if you have or have ever had glaucoma or seizures, or lung, heart, or liver disease.   - tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking oxazepam, call your doctor immediately.   - talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking oxazepam if you are 65 years of age or older. Older adults should take lower doses of oxazepam because higher doses may not be more effective and are more likely to cause serious side effects.    - if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking oxazepam.   - you should know that this medication may make you drowsy. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.   - tell your doctor if you use tobacco products. Cigarette smoking may decrease the effectiveness of this medication. Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet. Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for your next dose skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Oxazepam may cause side effects.

        "query": "how nicotine effects the brain",
        "document": "Nicotine and tobacco: The nicotine in tobacco can be addictive like alcohol, cocaine, and morphine. Tobacco is a plant grown for its leaves, which are smoked, chewed, or sniffed.     - Tobacco contains a chemical called nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive substance.   - Millions of people in the United States have been able to quit smoking. Although the number of cigarette smokers in the United States has dropped in recent years, the number of smokeless tobacco users has steadily increased. Smokeless tobacco products are either placed in the mouth, cheek, or lip and sucked or chewed on, or placed in the nasal passage. The nicotine in these products is absorbed at the same rate as smoking tobacco, and addiction is still very strong.     Both smoking and smokeless tobacco use carry many health risks. Nicotine use can have many different effects on the body. It can:     - Decrease the appetite; fear of weight gain makes some people unwilling to stop smoking   - Boost mood, give people a sense of well-being, and possibly even relieve minor depression   - Increase activity in the intestines   - Create more saliva and phlegm   - Increase the heart rate by around 10 to 20 beats per minute   - Increase blood pressure by 5 to 10 mm Hg   - Possibly cause sweating, nausea, and diarrhea   - Stimulate memory and alertness; people who use tobacco often depend on it to help them accomplish certain tasks and perform well      Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal appear within 2 to 3 hours after you last use tobacco. People who smoked the longest or smoked a greater number of cigarettes each day are more likely to have withdrawal symptoms. For those who are quitting, symptoms peak about 2 to 3 days later. Common symptoms include:     - Intense craving for nicotine   - Anxiety   - Depression   - Drowsiness or trouble sleeping   - Bad dreams and nightmares   - Feeling tense, restless, or frustrated   - Headaches   - Increased appetite and weight gain   - Problems concentrating      You may notice some or all of these symptoms when switching from regular to low-nicotine cigarettes or reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke. It is hard to stop smoking or using smokeless tobacco, but anyone can do it. There are many ways to quit smoking.   There are also resources to help you quit. Family members, friends, and co-workers may be supportive. Quitting tobacco is hard if you are trying to do it alone.   To be successful, you must really want to quit. Most people who have quit smoking were unsuccessful at least once in the past. Try not to view past attempts as failures. See them as learning experiences.   Most smokers find it hard to break all the habits they have created around smoking.   A smoking cessation program may improve your chance for success. These programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations.   Nicotine replacement therapy may also be helpful. It involves the use of products that provide low doses of nicotine, but none of the toxins found in smoke. Nicotine replacement comes in the form of:      - Gum   - Inhalers   - Throat lozenges   - Nasal spray   - Skin patches      You can buy many types of nicotine replacement without a prescription. The goal is to relieve cravings for nicotine and ease your withdrawal symptoms.   Health experts warn that e-cigarettes are not a replacement therapy for cigarette smoking. It is not known exactly how much nicotine is in e-cigarette cartridges, because information on labels is often wrong.   Your health care provider can also prescribe other types of medicines to help you quit and prevent you from starting again. Your provider can refer you to stop smoking programs. These are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. People who are trying to quit smoking often become discouraged when they do not succeed at first. Research shows that the more times you try, the more likely you are to succeed. If you start smoking again after you have tried to quit, do not give up. Look at what worked or did not work, think of new ways to quit smoking, and try again. There are many more reasons to quit using tobacco. Knowing the serious health risks from tobacco may help motivate you to quit. Tobacco and related chemicals can increase your risk of serious health problems such as cancer, lung disease, and heart attack. See your provider if you wish to stop smoking, or have already done so and are having withdrawal symptoms. Your provider can help recommend treatments. Updated by: Laura J.

        "query": "how nicotine effects the brain",
        "document": "Nicotine dependence: Nicotine dependence -- also called tobacco dependence -- is an addiction to tobacco products caused by the drug nicotine. Nicotine dependence means you can't stop using the substance, even though it's causing you harm. Nicotine produces physical and mood-altering effects in your brain that are temporarily pleasing. These effects make you want to use tobacco and lead to dependence. At the same time, stopping tobacco use causes withdrawal symptoms, including irritability and anxiety. While it's the nicotine in tobacco that causes nicotine dependence, the toxic effects of tobacco result from other substances in tobacco. Smokers have much higher rates of heart disease, stroke and cancer than nonsmokers do. Regardless of how long you've smoked, stopping smoking can improve your health. Many effective treatments for nicotine dependence are available to help you manage withdrawal and stop smoking for good. Ask your doctor for help. For some people, using any amount of tobacco can quickly lead to nicotine dependence. Signs that you may be addicted include: - You can't stop smoking. You've made one or more serious, but unsuccessful, attempts to stop.   - You experience withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop. Your attempts at stopping have caused physical and mood-related symptoms, such as strong cravings, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, frustration, anger, increased hunger, insomnia, constipation or diarrhea.   - You keep smoking despite health problems. Even though you've developed health problems with your lungs or your heart, you haven't been able to stop.   - You give up social or recreational activities in order to smoke. You may stop going to smoke-free restaurants or stop socializing with certain family members or friends because you can't smoke in these locations or situations. You're not alone if you've tried to stop smoking but haven't been able to stop for good. Most smokers make many attempts to stop smoking before they achieve stable, long-term abstinence from smoking. You're more likely to stop for good if you follow a treatment plan that addresses both the physical and the behavioral aspects of nicotine dependence. Using medications and working with a counselor specially trained to help people stop smoking (a tobacco treatment specialist) will significantly boost your chances of success. Ask your doctor, counselor or therapist to help you develop a treatment plan that works for you or to advise you on where to get help to stop smoking. Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that keeps you smoking. Nicotine is very addictive when delivered by inhaling tobacco smoke into the lungs, which quickly releases nicotine into the blood allowing it to get into the brain within seconds of taking a puff. In the brain nicotine increases the release of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters, which help regulate mood and behavior. Dopamine, one of these neurotransmitters, is released in the \"reward center\" of the brain and causes improved mood and feelings of pleasure. Experiencing these effects from nicotine is what makes tobacco so addictive. Nicotine dependence involves behavioral (routines, habits, feelings) as well as physical factors. These behavioral associations with smoking may act as triggers - situations or feelings that activate a craving for tobacco, even if you have not smoked for some time. Behaviors and cues that you may associate with smoking include: - Certain times of the day, such as first thing in the morning, with morning coffee or during breaks at work   - After a meal   - Drinking alcohol   - Certain places or friends   - Talking on the phone   - Stressful situations or when you're feeling down   - Sight or smell of a burning cigarette   - Driving your car To overcome your dependence on tobacco, you need to become aware of your triggers and develop a plan to deal with the behaviors and routines that you associate with smoking. Anyone who smokes or uses other forms of tobacco is at risk of becoming dependent. Factors that influence who will use tobacco include: - Genetics. The likelihood that you will start smoking and keep smoking may be partly inherited - genetic factors may influence how receptors on the surface of your brain's nerve cells respond to high doses of nicotine delivered by cigarettes.   - Home and peer influence. Children who grow up with parents who smoke are more likely to become smokers. Children with friends who smoke also are more likely to try cigarettes. Evidence suggests that smoking shown in movies and on the Internet can encourage young people to smoke.   - Age. Most people begin smoking during childhood or the teen years. The younger you are when you begin smoking, the greater the chance that you'll become a heavy smoker as an adult.   - Depression or other mental illness. Many studies show an association between depression and smoking. People who have depression, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other forms of mental illness are more likely to be smokers.   - Substance use. People who abuse alcohol and illegal drugs are more likely to be smokers. Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 known cancer-causing chemicals and thousands of other harmful substances. Even \"all natural\" or herbal cigarettes have chemicals that are harmful to your health. Smoking harms almost every organ of your body and impairs your body's immune system. About half of all regular smokers will die of a disease caused by tobacco. Women smokers are now at equal risk to men smokers of dying from lung cancer, COPD and cardiovascular disease caused by using tobacco. The negative health effects include: - Lung cancer and other lung diseases. Smoking causes nearly 9 out of 10 lung cancer cases. In addition, smoking causes other lung diseases, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking also makes asthma worse.   - Other cancers. Smoking is a major cause of cancers of the esophagus, larynx, throat (pharynx) and mouth and is related to cancers of the bladder, pancreas, kidney and cervix, and some leukemias. Overall, smoking causes 30 percent of all cancer deaths.   - Heart and circulatory system problems. Smoking increases your risk of dying of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease, including heart attack and stroke. Even smoking just one to four cigarettes daily increases your risk of heart disease. If you have heart or blood vessel disease, such as heart failure, smoking worsens your condition. However, stopping smoking reduces your risk of having a heart attack by 50 percent in the first year.   - Diabetes. Smoking increases insulin resistance, which can set the stage for the development of type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, smoking can speed the progress of complications, such as kidney disease and eye problems.   - Eye problems. Smoking can increase your risk of serious eye problems such as cataracts and loss of eyesight from macular degeneration.   - Infertility and impotence. Smoking increases the risk of reduced fertility in women and the risk of impotence in men.   - Pregnancy and newborn complications. Mothers who smoke while pregnant face a higher risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, lower birth weight and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in their newborns.   - Cold, flu and other illnesses. Smokers are more prone to respiratory infections, such as colds, flu and bronchitis.   - Weakened senses. Smoking deadens your senses of taste and smell, so food isn't as appetizing.   - Teeth and gum disease. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of developing inflammation of the gum (gingivitis) and a serious gum infection that can destroy the support system for teeth (periodontitis).   - Physical appearance. The chemicals in tobacco smoke can change the structure of your skin, causing premature aging and wrinkles. Smoking also yellows your teeth, fingers and fingernails.   - Risks to your family. Nonsmoking spouses and partners of smokers have a higher risk of lung cancer and heart disease compared with people who don't live with a smoker. If you smoke, your children will be more prone to SIDS, worsening asthma, ear infections and colds. Your doctor may ask you questions or have you complete a questionnaire to get a sense of how dependent you are on nicotine. The more cigarettes you smoke each day and the sooner you smoke after awakening, the more dependent you are. Knowing your degree of dependence will help your doctor determine the best treatment plan for you. Like most smokers, you've probably made at least one serious attempt to stop. But it's rare to stop smoking on your first attempt - especially if you try to do it without help. You're much more likely to stop if you use medications and counseling, which have both been proved effective, especially in combination. Medications Many treatments, including nicotine replacement therapy and non-nicotine medications, have been approved as safe and effective in treating nicotine dependence. Using more than one medication may help you get better results. For example, combining a longer acting medication with a short-acting nicotine replacement product may be beneficial. Talk to your health care provider about the right treatment for you. If you're pregnant or breast-feeding, you smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes a day, or you're under age 18, talk to your doctor before taking any over-the-counter nicotine replacement products. Nicotine replacement therapy Nicotine replacement therapy gives you nicotine without tobacco and the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. Nicotine replacement products help relieve withdrawal symptoms and cravings. The best time to start using nicotine replacement medication is on the date you've set to stop smoking. Some smokers start earlier in order to reduce smoking on their way to stopping altogether. The following nicotine replacement products are available over-the-counter: - Nicotine patch (NicoDerm CQ, Habitrol, others). The patch delivers nicotine through your skin and into your bloodstream. You wear a new patch each day. You typically use the patch for eight weeks or longer. If you haven't been able to stop smoking completely after two weeks of wearing the patch, ask your doctor about adjusting the dose or adding another nicotine replacement product. Common side effects include skin irritation, insomnia and vivid dreams. - Nicotine gum (Nicorette, others). This gum delivers nicotine to your blood through the lining of your mouth. Nicotine gum is often recommended to curb cravings. Chew the gum for a few times until you feel a mild tingling or peppery taste, then park the gum between your cheek and gumline for several minutes. This chewing and parking allows nicotine to be gradually absorbed in your bloodstream. Mouth irritation is a common side effect. Other side effects are often a result of overly vigorous chewing that releases nicotine too quickly. These include heartburn, nausea and hiccups. - Nicotine lozenge (Commit, Nicorette mini lozenge, others). This lozenge dissolves in your mouth and, like nicotine gum, delivers nicotine through the lining of your mouth. Place the lozenge in your mouth between your gumline and cheek or under your tongue and allow it to dissolve. You'll start with one lozenge every one to two hours and gradually increase the time between lozenges. Avoid drinking anything right before, while using or right after the lozenge. Side effects include mouth irritation as well as nicotine-related effects such as heartburn, nausea and hiccups. These nicotine replacement products are available by prescription: - Nicotine nasal spray (Nicotrol NS). The nicotine in this product, sprayed directly into each nostril, is absorbed through your nasal membranes into your blood vessels. The nasal spray delivers nicotine a bit quicker than gum, lozenges or the patch, but not as rapidly as smoking a cigarette. It's usually prescribed for three-month periods for up to six months. Nasal and throat irritation, runny nose, sneezing and coughing are common side effects. - Nicotine inhaler (Nicotrol). This device is shaped something like a cigarette holder. You puff on it, and it delivers nicotine vapor into your mouth. You absorb the nicotine through the lining in your mouth, where it then enters your bloodstream. Common side effects are mouth and throat irritation and occasional coughing. Non-nicotine medications Medications that don't contain nicotine and are available by prescription include: - Bupropion (Zyban). The antidepressant drug bupropion increases levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, brain chemicals that are also boosted by nicotine. Typically your doctor will advise you to start bupropion one week before you stop smoking. Bupropion has the advantage of helping to minimize weight gain after you quit smoking. Common side effects include insomnia, agitation, headache and dry mouth. If you have a history of seizures or serious head trauma, such as a skull fracture, you shouldn't take this drug. - Varenicline (Chantix). This medication acts on the brain's nicotine receptors, decreasing withdrawal symptoms and reducing the feelings of pleasure you get from smoking. Typically your doctor will advise you to start varenicline one week before you stop smoking. Common side effects include nausea, headache, insomnia and vivid dreams. Rarely, varenicline has been associated with serious psychiatric symptoms, such as depressed mood and suicidal thoughts. - Nortriptyline (Pamelor). This medication may be prescribed if other medications haven't helped. This tricyclic antidepressant acts by increasing the levels of the brain neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Common side effects may include dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness and constipation. Counseling, support groups and other programs Combining medications with behavioral counseling provides the best chance for establishing long-term smoking abstinence. Medications help you cope by reducing withdrawal symptoms including tobacco craving, while behavioral treatments help you develop the skills you need to avoid tobacco over the long run. The more time you spend with a counselor, the better your treatment results will be. Several types of counseling and support can help with stopping smoking: - Telephone counseling. No matter where you live, you can take advantage of phone counseling to help you give up tobacco. Every state in the U.S. has a telephone quit line, and some have more than one. To find the options in your state, call 800-QUIT-NOW (800-784-8669). - Individual or group counseling program. Your doctor may recommend local support groups or a treatment program where counseling is provided by a tobacco treatment specialist. Counseling helps you learn techniques for preparing to stop smoking and provides support for you during the process. Many hospitals, health care plans, health care providers and employers offer treatment programs or have tobacco treatment specialists who are certified to provide treatment for nicotine dependence. Nicotine Anonymous groups are available in many locations to provide support for smokers trying to quit. Some medical centers provide residential treatment programs - the most intensive treatment available. - Internet-based programs. Several websites offer support and strategies for people who want to stop smoking. BecomeAnEX is free and provides information and techniques as well as blogs, community forums, ask the expert and many other features. Text messaging services, including personalized reminders about a quit-smoking plan, also may prove helpful. Methods to avoid It's not a good idea to substitute another type of tobacco use for cigarette smoking. Tobacco in any form is not safe. Even products that deliver nicotine without tobacco are risky. Stick with proven stop-smoking aids and steer clear of the following products: - Dissolvable tobacco products. Tobacco pouches, lozenges, strips or other products contain small amounts of tobacco and nicotine you hold or dissolve in your mouth. There is no evidence they will help you stop smoking and little is known about their health effects. - E-cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are battery-powered devices that heat liquid containing nicotine into a vapor to be inhaled. Because these products are new, there isn't much data about possible safety risks. Studies of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation have shown mixed results. For these reasons, e-cigarettes aren't recommended for people trying to quit smoking. - Flavored cigarettes. Clove cigarettes (kreteks) and flavored cigarettes (bidis) carry the same health risks as smoking regular cigarettes and can cause additional health problems. Although they're banned in the United States, flavored cigarettes are available in other countries. - Hookahs (narghiles). These are water pipes that burn tobacco, and the smoke is inhaled through a hose. They are not safer than cigarettes. The water does not filter out toxins in the smoke, and the water and pipe have a risk of transmitting infections. - Nicotine lollipops and balms. Products containing nicotine salicylate are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and they pose a risk for accidental use by children. - Pipes and cigars. These products have similar, though less frequent, health risks as cigarettes, and they are not a safe alternative. - Smokeless tobacco and snuff (snus). These products contain nicotine in amounts similar to cigarettes and increase your risk of mouth and throat cancer, tooth and gum diseases, and other health problems. It's important to have a plan for managing nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms are usually the most intense during the first week after you stop smoking. They may continue for several weeks, with declining intensity. Although most nicotine withdrawal symptoms pass within a month, you may occasionally experience a strong urge or craving to smoke months after stopping. Triggers or cues that were associated with your smoking can provoke these urges or cravings. Here's what you can do to help manage nicotine withdrawal symptoms: - Exercise regularly. Regular physical activity has been found to reduce withdrawal symptoms and help people stop smoking. Exercise also helps avoid potential weight gain often associated with stopping. - Wait out cravings. Cravings or urges usually last less than five minutes. Wash the dishes, go for a walk or have a healthy snack, such as carrots, an apple or sunflower seeds, which will keep your mouth busy. Do something that keeps your hands busy, and before you know it, the urge will have passed. This is why you want to get rid of tobacco supplies when you decide to quit. You don't want to have any on hand when a craving hits. - Identify rationalizations. If you find yourself thinking, \"I'll just smoke one to get through this tough time\" or \"Just one won't hurt,\" recognize it as a message that can derail your plan. Review your reasons for quitting, and replace that thought with something positive to support your stopping. - Talk to a support person. If you're feeling anxious or depressed or need encouragement, a support person can help you get through a difficult craving. - Avoid high-risk situations. Know your triggers, and stay away from people, places and situations that tempt you to smoke. - Eat regular, healthy meals. Include plenty of fruits and vegetables, and drink more water. Many products claim to be smoking-cessation aids. Many also claim to be \"natural.\" Just remember that \"natural\" doesn't necessarily mean \"safe.\" Talk with your doctor before trying any alternative medicine treatments. - Acupuncture. Acupuncture involves stimulating points on the body, typically with thin, solid, metallic needles. Several studies have been conducted on the effects of acupuncture or acupressure for smoking cessation, but there's no definitive evidence that it works. - Herbs and supplements. A few studies have been conducted on the dietary supplements SAMe, silver acetate and St. John's wort for the treatment of tobacco dependence, but there is no current evidence that any natural product improves smoking cessation rates. - Hypnosis. Although no evidence supports the use of hypnosis - also called hypnotherapy - in smoking cessation, some people find it helpful. If you choose to pursue hypnosis, talk to your doctor about finding a reputable therapist. - Meditation. Although no evidence supports the effectiveness of meditation in smoking cessation, some people find it helpful to reduce symptoms of anxiety."

        "document": "Cervical dysplasia: Cervical dysplasia refers to abnormal changes in the cells on the surface of the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina.   The changes are not cancer. But they are considered to be precancerous. This means they can lead to cancer of the cervix if not treated. Cervical dysplasia can develop at any age. However, follow up and treatment will depend on your age.   Most often, cervical dysplasia is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual contact. There are many types of HPV. Some types lead to cervical dysplasia or cancer. Other types of HPV can cause genital warts.   The following may increase your risk for cervical dysplasia:     - Having sex before age 18   - Having a baby before age 16   - Having had multiple sexual partners   - Having other illnesses, such as diabetes or HIV   - Using medicines that suppress your immune system   - Smoking Most of the time, there are no symptoms. You will have a pelvic exam.    Cervical dysplasia that is seen on a Pap smear is called squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL). On the Pap smear report, these changes will be described as:     - Low-grade (LSIL)   - High-grade (HSIL)   - Possibly cancerous (malignant)   - Atypical glandular cells (AGUS)   - Atypical squamous cells      You will need more tests if a Pap smear shows abnormal cells or cervical dysplasia. If the changes were mild, follow-up Pap smears may be all that is needed.   A biopsy to confirm the condition is often needed, however. This may be done using colposcopy-directed biopsy. A colposcopy is a procedure performed in your health care provider's office. Any areas of concern will be biopsied. The biopsies are very small and most women feel only a small cramp.    Dysplasia that is seen on a biopsy of the cervix is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). It is grouped into 3 categories:     - CIN I -- mild dysplasia   - CIN II -- moderate to marked dysplasia   - CIN III -- severe dysplasia to carcinoma in situ      Some strains of HPV are known to cause cervical cancer. An HPV DNA test can identify the high-risk types of HPV linked to this cancer. This test may be done:     - As a screening test for women over age 30   - For women of any age who have a slightly abnormal Pap test result Treatment depends on the degree of dysplasia. Mild dysplasia (LSIL or CIN I) may go away without treatment.     - You may only need careful follow-up by your provider with repeat Pap smears every 6 to 12 months.   - If the changes do not go away or get worse, treatment is needed.      Treatment for moderate-to-severe dysplasia or mild dysplasia that does not go away may include:     - Cryosurgery to freeze abnormal cells   - Laser therapy, which uses light to burn away abnormal tissue   - LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure), which uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue   - Surgery to remove the abnormal tissue (cone biopsy)   - Hysterectomy (in rare cases)      If you have had dysplasia, you will need to have repeat exams every 12 months or as recommended by your provider.   Make sure to get the HPV vaccine when it is offered to you. This vaccine prevents many cervical cancers. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment cures most cases of cervical dysplasia. However, the condition may return.   Without treatment, severe cervical dysplasia may change into cervical cancer. Call your provider if your age is 21 or older and you have never had a pelvic exam and Pap smear. Ask your provider about the HPV vaccine. Girls who receive this vaccine before they become sexually active reduce their chance of getting cervical cancer.   You can reduce your risk of developing cervical dysplasia by taking the following steps:     - Do not smoke. Smoking increases your risk of developing more severe dysplasia and cancer.   - Get vaccinated for HPV between ages 9 to 26.   - Do not have sex until you are 18 or older.   - Practice safe sex, and use a condom.   - Practice monogamy. This means you have only one sexual partner at a time. Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

        "query": "how often do you need a pap smear",
        "document": "Pap test: The Pap test checks for cervical cancer. Cells scraped from the opening of the cervix are examined under a microscope. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina.   This test is sometimes called a Pap smear. You lie on a table and place your feet in stirrups. The health care provider gently places an instrument called a speculum into the vagina to open it slightly. This allows the provider to see inside the vagina and cervix.   Cells are gently scraped from the cervix area. The sample of cells is sent to a lab for examination. Tell your provider about all the medicines you are taking. Some birth control pills that contain estrogen or progestin may affect test results.    Also tell your provider if you:      - Have had an abnormal Pap test   - Might be pregnant      DO NOT do the following for 24 hours before the test:     - Douche (douching should never be done)   - Have intercourse   - Use tampons      Avoid scheduling your Pap test while you have your period (are menstruating). Blood may make the Pap test results less accurate. If you are having unexpected bleeding, do not cancel your exam. Your provider will determine if the Pap test can still be done.   Empty your bladder just before the test. A Pap test causes little to no discomfort for most women. It can cause some discomfort, similar to menstrual cramps. You may also feel some pressure during the exam.    You may bleed a little bit after the test. The Pap test is a screening test for cervical cancer. Most cervical cancers can be detected early if a woman has routine Pap tests.   Screening should start at age 21.    After the first test:     - You should have a Pap test every 3 years to check for cervical cancer.   - If you are over age 30 and you also have HPV testing done, and both the Pap test and HPV test are normal, you can be tested every 5 years (HPV is the human papillomavirus, the virus that causes genital warts and cervical cancer).   - Most women can stop having Pap tests after age 65 to 70 as long as they have had 3 negative tests within the past 10 years.      You may not need to have a Pap test if you have had a total hysterectomy (uterus and cervix removed) and have not had an abnormal Pap test, cervical cancer, or other pelvic cancer. Discuss this with your provider. A normal result means there are no abnormal cells present. The Pap test is not 100% accurate. Cervical cancer may be missed in a small number of cases. Most of the time, cervical cancer develops very slowly, and follow-up Pap tests should find any changes in time for treatment. Abnormal results are grouped as follows:   ASCUS or AGUS:     - This result means there are atypical cells, but it is uncertain or unclear what these changes mean   - The changes may be due to HPV   - They may also mean there are changes that may lead to cancer      LOW-GRADE DYSPLASIA (LSIL) OR HIGH-GRADE DYSPLASIA (HSIL):     - This means changes that may lead to cancer are present   - The risk of cervical cancer is greater with HSIL      CARCINOMA IN SITU (CIS):     - This result most often means the abnormal changes are likely to lead to cervical cancer if not treated      ATYPICAL SQUAMOUS CELLS (ASC):      - Abnormal changes have been found and may be HSIL      ATYPICAL GLANDULAR CELLS (AGC):      - Cell changes that may lead to cancer are seen in the upper part of the cervical canal or inside the uterus      When a Pap test shows abnormal changes, further testing or follow-up is needed. The next step depends on the results of the Pap test, your previous history of Pap tests, and risk factors you may have for cervical cancer.   For minor cell changes, doctors will recommend another Pap test in 6 to 12 months.   Follow-up testing or treatment may include:     - Colposcopy-directed biopsy   - An HPV test to check for the presence of the HPV virus types most likely to cause cancer   - Cervix cryosurgery   - Cone biopsy Updated by: Irina Burd, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

After the first test:     - Women ages 21 through 29 should have a Pap smear every 3 years.   - Women ages 30 through 65 should be screened with either a Pap smear every 3 years or a Pap smear and HPV test every 5 years.   - If you or your sexual partner has other new partners, you should have a Pap smear every 3 years.   - Women ages 65 through 70 can stop having Pap smears as long as they have had 3 normal tests within the past 10 years.   - Women who have been treated for precancer (cervical dysplasia) should continue to have Pap smears for 20 years after treatment or until age 65, whichever is longer.      Talk with your provider about how often you should have a Pap smear."

        "document": "Nicotine and tobacco: The nicotine in tobacco can be addictive like alcohol, cocaine, and morphine. Tobacco is a plant grown for its leaves, which are smoked, chewed, or sniffed.     - Tobacco contains a chemical called nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive substance.   - Millions of people in the United States have been able to quit smoking. Although the number of cigarette smokers in the United States has dropped in recent years, the number of smokeless tobacco users has steadily increased. Smokeless tobacco products are either placed in the mouth, cheek, or lip and sucked or chewed on, or placed in the nasal passage. The nicotine in these products is absorbed at the same rate as smoking tobacco, and addiction is still very strong.     Both smoking and smokeless tobacco use carry many health risks. Nicotine use can have many different effects on the body. It can:     - Decrease the appetite; fear of weight gain makes some people unwilling to stop smoking   - Boost mood, give people a sense of well-being, and possibly even relieve minor depression   - Increase activity in the intestines   - Create more saliva and phlegm   - Increase the heart rate by around 10 to 20 beats per minute   - Increase blood pressure by 5 to 10 mm Hg   - Possibly cause sweating, nausea, and diarrhea   - Stimulate memory and alertness; people who use tobacco often depend on it to help them accomplish certain tasks and perform well      Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal appear within 2 to 3 hours after you last use tobacco. People who smoked the longest or smoked a greater number of cigarettes each day are more likely to have withdrawal symptoms. For those who are quitting, symptoms peak about 2 to 3 days later. Common symptoms include:     - Intense craving for nicotine   - Anxiety   - Depression   - Drowsiness or trouble sleeping   - Bad dreams and nightmares   - Feeling tense, restless, or frustrated   - Headaches   - Increased appetite and weight gain   - Problems concentrating      You may notice some or all of these symptoms when switching from regular to low-nicotine cigarettes or reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke. It is hard to stop smoking or using smokeless tobacco, but anyone can do it. There are many ways to quit smoking.   There are also resources to help you quit. Family members, friends, and co-workers may be supportive. Quitting tobacco is hard if you are trying to do it alone.   To be successful, you must really want to quit. Most people who have quit smoking were unsuccessful at least once in the past. Try not to view past attempts as failures. See them as learning experiences.   Most smokers find it hard to break all the habits they have created around smoking.   A smoking cessation program may improve your chance for success. These programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations.   Nicotine replacement therapy may also be helpful. It involves the use of products that provide low doses of nicotine, but none of the toxins found in smoke. Nicotine replacement comes in the form of:      - Gum   - Inhalers   - Throat lozenges   - Nasal spray   - Skin patches      You can buy many types of nicotine replacement without a prescription. The goal is to relieve cravings for nicotine and ease your withdrawal symptoms.   Health experts warn that e-cigarettes are not a replacement therapy for cigarette smoking. It is not known exactly how much nicotine is in e-cigarette cartridges, because information on labels is often wrong.   Your health care provider can also prescribe other types of medicines to help you quit and prevent you from starting again. Your provider can refer you to stop smoking programs. These are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, work sites, and national organizations. People who are trying to quit smoking often become discouraged when they do not succeed at first. Research shows that the more times you try, the more likely you are to succeed. If you start smoking again after you have tried to quit, do not give up. Look at what worked or did not work, think of new ways to quit smoking, and try again. There are many more reasons to quit using tobacco. Knowing the serious health risks from tobacco may help motivate you to quit. Tobacco and related chemicals can increase your risk of serious health problems such as cancer, lung disease, and heart attack. See your provider if you wish to stop smoking, or have already done so and are having withdrawal symptoms. Your provider can help recommend treatments. Updated by: Laura J.

Behavioral treatment is often tried first and may have long-lasting benefits:     - Cognitive behavioral therapy helps you understand and change the thoughts that are causing your condition, as well as learn to recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts.   - Systematic desensitization or exposure therapy may be used. You are asked to relax, then imagine the situations that cause the anxiety, working from the least fearful to the most fearful. Gradual exposure to the real-life situation has also been used with success to help people overcome their fears.   - Social skills training may involve social contact in a group therapy situation to practice social skills. Role playing and modeling are techniques used to help you become more comfortable relating to others in a social situation.      Certain medicines, usually used to treat depression, may be very helpful for this disorder. They work by preventing your symptoms or making them less severe. You must take these medicines every day. DO NOT stop taking them without talking with your provider.   Medicines called sedatives (or hypnotics) may also be prescribed.     - These medicines should only be taken under a doctor's direction.   - Your doctor will prescribe a limited amount of these drugs. They should not to be used everyday.   - They may be used when symptoms become very severe or when you are about to be exposed to something that always brings on your symptoms.   - If you are prescribed a sedative, do not drink alcohol while on this medicine.      Lifestyle changes may help reduce how often the attacks occur.     - Get regular exercise, enough sleep, and regularly scheduled meals.   - Reduce or avoid the use of caffeine, some over-the-counter cold medicines, and other stimulants."

        "query": "how to loose weight",
        "document": "Losing weight after pregnancy: You should plan to return to your pre-pregnancy weight by 6 to 12 months after delivery. Most women lose half of their baby weight by 6 weeks after childbirth (postpartum). The rest most often comes off over the next several months.    A healthy diet with daily exercise will help you shed the pounds. Breastfeeding can also help with postpartum weight loss. Your body needs time to recover from childbirth. If you lose weight too soon after childbirth, it can take longer for you to recover. Give yourself until your 6-week checkup before trying to slim down. If you are breastfeeding, wait until your baby is at least 2 months old and your milk supply has normalized before drastically cutting calories.     - Aim for a weight loss of about a pound and a half a week. You can do this by eating healthy foods and adding in exercise once you are cleared by your health care provider for regular physical activity.   - Women who are exclusively breastfeeding need about 500 more calories per day than they did before pregnancy. Get these calories from healthy choices such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, and lean protein.   - DO NOT drop below the minimum number of calories you need. If you are breastfeeding, you will want to lose weight slowly. Weight loss that happens too fast can make you produce less milk. Losing about a pound and a half (670 grams) a week should not affect your milk supply or your health.    Breastfeeding makes your body burn calories which helps you lose weight. If you are patient, you may be surprised at how much weight you lose naturally while breastfeeding. These healthy eating tips will help you lose weight safely.     - DO NOT skip meals. With a new baby, many new moms forget to eat. If you do not eat, you will have less energy, and it will not help you lose weight.   - Eat 5 to 6 small meals a day with healthy snacks in between (rather than 3 larger meals).   - Eat breakfast. Even if you do not normally eat in the mornings, get into the habit of having breakfast. It will give you energy to start your day and stop you from feeling tired later.   - Slow down. When you take your time eating, you will notice that it is easier to tell that you are full. It is tempting to multitask, but if you focus on your meal you will be less likely to overeat.   - Choose nonfat or low-fat dairy products.    - When you reach for a snack try to include foods with fiber and protein to help keep you full (such as raw bell pepper or carrot with bean dip, apple slices with peanut butter, or a slice of whole-wheat toast with hard-boiled egg). Drink at least 12 cups of fluid a day.    - Keep a water bottle near the spot where you usually feed the baby, that way you'll remember to drink when they do.   - Limit drinks like sodas, juices, and other fluids with added sugar and calories. They can add up and keep you from losing weight.   - Choose broiled or baked rather than fried foods.   - Limit sweets, sugar, saturated fat and trans fats. DO NOT go on a crash diet (not eating enough) or a fad diet (popular diets that limit certain types of foods and nutrients). They will probably make you drop pounds at first, but those first few pounds you lose are fluid and will come back.    Other pounds you lose on a crash diet may be muscle instead of fat. You will gain back any fat you lose on a crash diet once you return to normal eating. You may not be able to return to your exact pre-pregnancy shape. For many women, pregnancy causes lasting changes in the body. You may have a softer belly, wider hips, and a larger waistline. Make your goals about your new body realistic. A healthy diet combined with regular exercise is the best way to shed the pounds. Exercise will help you lose fat instead of muscle.    Once you are ready to start losing weight, eat a little less and move a little more each day. It may be tempting to push yourself into a hard routine for fast weight loss. But rapid weight loss is not healthy and is hard on your body.    DO NOT overdo it. Just a quick walk around the block with your baby in the stroller is a great way to start adding exercise to your daily routine. Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

        "document": "Diet for rapid weight loss: Rapid weight loss diet is a type of diet in which you lose more than 2 pounds (1 kilogram, kg) a week over several weeks. To lose weight this quickly you eat very few calories. These diets are most often for obese people who need to lose weight quickly because of a health problem. People on these diets should be followed closely by a health care provider. Rapid weight loss is not safe for most people to do on their own.   These diets are only to be used for a short time and are not recommended for more than several weeks. The types of rapid weight loss diets are described below. On a VLCD, you may have as few as 800 calories a day and may lose up to 3 to 5 pounds (1.5 to 2 kg) week. Most VLCDs use meal replacements, such as formulas, soups, shakes, and bars instead of regular meals. This helps ensure that you get all of the nutrients you need each day.    A VLCD is only recommended for adults who are obese and need to lose weight for health reasons. These diets are often used before weight-loss surgery. You should only use a VLCD with the help of your health care provider. Most experts DO NOT recommend using a VLCD for more than 12 weeks. These diets usually allow about 1000 to 1200 calories a day for women and 1200 to 1600 calories a day for men. An LCD is a better choice than a VLCD for most people who want to lose weight quickly. But you should still be supervised by a provider. You will not lose weight as fast with an LCD, but you can lose just as much weight with a VLCD.    An LCD may use a mix of meal replacements and regular food. This makes it easier to follow than a VLCD. Some fad diets also severely limit calories to achieve rapid weight loss. In many cases, these diets are not safe. Once you stop the diet, you are at risk for regaining the weight if you return to your old eating habits. For most people, it is safest to choose a diet in which you lose a 1/2 pound to 2 pounds (225 grams to 1 kg) a week. Rapid weight loss is more about cutting calories than exercising. Talk with your provider about what type of exercise you should do while you are on this type of diet. Your provider may suggest waiting until you are on a more long-term diet to start exercising. Rapid weight loss diet is usually for people who have health problems because of obesity. For these people, losing a lot of weight quickly can help improve:     - Diabetes   - High cholesterol   - High blood pressure You should only follow one of these diets with the help of your provider. Losing more than one 1 or 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kg) a week is not safe for most people. It can cause you to lose muscle, water, and bone density. Rapid weight loss can also cause some side effects including:     - Gallstones   - Gout   - Fatigue   - Constipation   - Diarrhea   - Nausea      People who lose weight quickly are also more likely to gain back the weight quickly. This can lead to other health problems.   In general, a rapid weight loss diet is not safe for children.

Hormonal therapy is treatment that decreases the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer.   Hormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. The treatment can help relieve symptoms and prevent further growth and spread of cancer. But it does not cure the cancer.   The main type of hormone therapy is called a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones (LH-RH) agonist:     - The medicine blocks the testicles from making testosterone. The drugs must be given by injection, usually every 3 to 6 months.   - Possible side effects include nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, anemia, fatigue, thinning bones (osteoporosis), reduced sexual desire, decreased muscle mass, weight gain, and impotence.      The other type of hormone medicine is called an androgen-blocking drug:     - It is often given along with LH-RH drugs to block the effect of testosterone produced by the adrenal glands, which make a small amount of testosterone.   - Possible side effects include erection problems, reduced sexual desire, liver problems, diarrhea, and enlarged breasts.

        "document": "Prostate cancer - treatment: Treatment for your prostate cancer is chosen after a thorough evaluation. Your doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of each treatment.   Sometimes your doctor may recommend 1 treatment for you because of your type of cancer and risk factors. Other times, there may be 2 or more treatments that could be good for you.   Factors you and your doctor must think about include:     - Your age and other medical problems you may have   - Side effects that occur with each type of treatment   - How much the prostate cancer has spread   - Your Gleason score, which tells how likely it is that cancer has already spread   - Your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result      Ask your doctor to explain these things following about your treatment choices:     - Which choices offer the best chance of curing your cancer or controlling its spread?   - How likely is it that you will have different side effects, and how they will affect your life? Radical prostatectomy is a surgery to remove the prostate and some of the surrounding tissue. It is an option when the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland.   Healthy men who will likely live 10 or more years after being diagnosed with prostate cancer often have this procedure.   Be aware that it is not always possible to know for certain, before surgery, if the cancer has spread beyond the prostate gland.   Possible problems after surgery include difficulty controlling urine and erection problems. Also, some men need further treatments after this surgery. Radiation therapy works best for treating prostate cancer that has not spread outside of the prostate. It may also be used after surgery if there is a risk that cancer cells are still present. Radiation is sometimes used for pain relief when cancer has spread to the bone.   External beam radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays pointed at the prostate gland:     - Before treatment, the radiation therapist uses a special pen to mark the part of the body that is to be treated.   - Radiation is delivered to the prostate gland using a machine similar to a regular x-ray machine. The treatment itself is usually painless.   - Treatment is done in a radiation oncology center that is usually connected to a hospital.   - Treatment is usually done 5 days a week for 6 to 8 weeks.      Side effects may include:     - Appetite loss   - Diarrhea   - Erection problems   - Fatigue   - Rectal burning or injury   - Skin reactions   - Urinary incontinence, the feeling of needing to urinate urgently, or blood in the urine      There are reports of secondary cancers arising from the radiation as well.   Proton therapy is another kind of radiation therapy used to treat prostate cancer. Proton beams target the tumor precisely, so there is less damage to the surrounding tissue. This therapy is not widely accepted or used. Brachytherapy is often used for small prostate cancers that are found early and are slow-growing. Brachytherapy may be combined with external beam radiation therapy for more advanced cancers.   Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive seeds inside the prostate gland.     - A surgeon inserts small needles through the skin beneath your scrotum to inject the seeds. The seeds are so small that you do not feel them.   - The seeds are left in place permanently.      Side effects may include:     - Pain, swelling, or bruising in the penis or scrotum   - Red-brown urine or semen   - Impotence   - Incontinence   - Urinary retention   - Diarrhea Testosterone is the main male hormone. Prostate tumors need testosterone to grow. Hormonal therapy is treatment that decreases the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer.

        "document": "Atherosclerosis (TREATMENTS): Treatments for atherosclerosis may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures or surgery. The goals of treatment include: Lowering the risk of blood clots forming Preventing atherosclerosis-related diseases Reducing risk factors in an effort to slow or stop the buildup of plaque Relieving symptoms Widening or bypassing plaque-clogged arteries Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have atherosclerosis.\u00a0Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include heart-healthy eating, aiming for a healthy weight, managing stress, physical activity and quitting smoking. Medicines Sometimes lifestyle changes alone aren\u2019t enough to control your cholesterol levels. For example, you also may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have: Coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a prior stroke Diabetes High LDL cholesterol levels Doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with people who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to: Lower your blood pressure Lower your blood sugar levels Prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack and stroke Prevent inflammation Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Don\u2019t change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your atherosclerosis. Medical Procedures and Surgery If you have severe atherosclerosis, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure or surgery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty, is a procedure that\u2019s used to open blocked or narrowed coronary (heart) arteries. PCI can improve blood flow to the heart and relieve chest pain. Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to keep it open after the procedure. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a type of surgery. In CABG, arteries or veins from other areas in your body are used to bypass or go around your narrowed coronary arteries. CABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack. Bypass grafting also can be used for leg arteries. For this surgery, a healthy blood vessel is used to bypass a narrowed or blocked artery in one of the legs. The healthy blood vessel redirects blood around the blocked artery, improving blood flow to the leg. Carotid endarterectomy is a type of surgery to remove plaque buildup from the carotid arteries in the neck. This procedure restores blood flow to the brain, which can help prevent a stroke."

        "document": "Arteriosclerosis / atherosclerosis: Arteriosclerosis occurs when the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients from your heart to the rest of your body (arteries) become thick and stiff - sometimes restricting blood flow to your organs and tissues. Healthy arteries are flexible and elastic, but over time, the walls in your arteries can harden, a condition commonly called hardening of the arteries. Atherosclerosis is a specific type of arteriosclerosis, but the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Atherosclerosis refers to the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on your artery walls (plaques), which can restrict blood flow. These plaques can burst, triggering a blood clot. Although atherosclerosis is often considered a heart problem, it can affect arteries anywhere in your body. Atherosclerosis may be preventable and is treatable. Atherosclerosis develops gradually. Mild atherosclerosis usually doesn't have any symptoms. You usually won't have atherosclerosis symptoms until an artery is so narrowed or clogged that it can't supply adequate blood to your organs and tissues. Sometimes a blood clot completely blocks blood flow, or even breaks apart and can trigger a heart attack or stroke. Symptoms of moderate to severe atherosclerosis depend on which arteries are affected. For example: - If you have atherosclerosis in your heart arteries, you may have symptoms, such as chest pain or pressure (angina).   - If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your brain, you may have signs and symptoms such as sudden numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, difficulty speaking or slurred speech, temporary loss of vision in one eye, or drooping muscles in your face. These signal a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which, if left untreated, may progress to a stroke.   - If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries in your arms and legs, you may have symptoms of peripheral artery disease, such as leg pain when walking (claudication).   - If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your kidneys, you develop high blood pressure or kidney failure. When to see a doctor If you think you have atherosclerosis, talk to your doctor. Also pay attention to early symptoms of inadequate blood flow, such as chest pain (angina), leg pain or numbness. Early diagnosis and treatment can stop atherosclerosis from worsening and prevent a heart attack, stroke or another medical emergency. Atherosclerosis is a slow, progressive disease that may begin as early as childhood. Although the exact cause is unknown, atherosclerosis may start with damage or injury to the inner layer of an artery. The damage may be caused by: - High blood pressure   - High cholesterol   - High triglycerides, a type of fat (lipid) in your blood   - Smoking and other sources of tobacco   - Insulin resistance, obesity or diabetes   - Inflammation from diseases, such as arthritis, lupus or infections, or inflammation of unknown cause Once the inner wall of an artery is damaged, blood cells and other substances often clump at the injury site and build up in the inner lining of the artery. Over time, fatty deposits (plaques) made of cholesterol and other cellular products also build up at the injury site and harden, narrowing your arteries. The organs and tissues connected to the blocked arteries then don't receive enough blood to function properly. Eventually, pieces of the fatty deposits may break off and enter your bloodstream. In addition, the smooth lining of a plaque may rupture, spilling cholesterol and other substances into your bloodstream. This may cause a blood clot, which can block the blood flow to a specific part of your body, such as occurs when blocked blood flow to your heart causes a heart attack. A blood clot can also travel to other parts of your body, blocking flow to another organ. Hardening of the arteries occurs over time. Besides aging, factors that increase the risk of atherosclerosis include: - High blood pressure   - High cholesterol   - Diabetes   - Obesity   - Smoking and other tobacco use   - A family history of early heart disease   - Lack of exercise   - An unhealthy diet The complications of atherosclerosis depend on which arteries are blocked. For example: - Coronary artery disease. When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries close to your heart, you may develop coronary artery disease, which can cause chest pain (angina), a heart attack or heart failure.   - Carotid artery disease. When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries close to your brain, you may develop carotid artery disease, which can cause a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.   - Peripheral artery disease. When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries in your arms or legs, you may develop circulation problems in your arms and legs called peripheral artery disease. This can make you less sensitive to heat and cold, increasing your risk of burns or frostbite. In rare cases, poor circulation in your arms or legs can cause tissue death (gangrene).   -   Aneurysms. Atherosclerosis can also cause aneurysms, a serious complication that can occur anywhere in your body. An aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of your artery.  Most people with aneurysms have no symptoms. Pain and throbbing in the area of an aneurysm may occur and is a medical emergency.  If an aneurysm bursts, you may face life-threatening internal bleeding. Although this is usually a sudden, catastrophic event, a slow leak is possible. If a blood clot within an aneurysm dislodges, it may block an artery at some distant point.    - Chronic kidney disease. Atherosclerosis can cause the arteries leading to your kidneys to narrow, preventing oxygenated blood from reaching them. Over time, this can affect your kidney function, keeping waste from exiting your body. During a physical exam, your doctor may find signs of narrowed, enlarged or hardened arteries, including: - A weak or absent pulse below the narrowed area of your artery - Decreased blood pressure in an affected limb - Whooshing sounds (bruits) over your arteries, heard using a stethoscope Depending on the results of the physical exam, your doctor may suggest one or more diagnostic tests, including: - Blood tests. Lab tests can detect increased levels of cholesterol and blood sugar that may increase the risk of atherosclerosis. You'll need to go without eating or drinking anything but water for nine to 12 hours before your blood test. Your doctor should tell you ahead of time if this test will be performed during your visit. - Doppler ultrasound. Your doctor may use a special ultrasound device (Doppler ultrasound) to measure your blood pressure at various points along your arm or leg. These measurements can help your doctor gauge the degree of any blockages, as well as the speed of blood flow in your arteries. - Ankle-brachial index. This test can tell if you have atherosclerosis in the arteries in your legs and feet. Your doctor may compare the blood pressure in your ankle with the blood pressure in your arm. This is known as the ankle-brachial index. An abnormal difference may indicate peripheral vascular disease, which is usually caused by atherosclerosis. - Electrocardiogram (ECG). An electrocardiogram records electrical signals as they travel through your heart. An ECG can often reveal evidence of a previous heart attack. If your signs and symptoms occur most often during exercise, your doctor may ask you to walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike during an ECG. - Stress test. A stress test, also called an exercise stress test, is used to gather information about how well your heart works during physical activity. Because exercise makes your heart pump harder and faster than it does during most daily activities, an exercise stress test can reveal problems within your heart that might not be noticeable otherwise. An exercise stress test usually involves walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while your heart rhythm, blood pressure and breathing are monitored. In some types of stress tests, pictures will be taken of your heart, such as during a stress echocardiogram (ultrasound) or nuclear stress test. If you're unable to exercise, you may receive a medication that mimics the effect of exercise on your heart. - Cardiac catheterization and angiogram. This test can show if your coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked. A liquid dye is injected into the arteries of your heart through a long, thin tube (catheter) that's fed through an artery, usually in your leg, to the arteries in your heart. As the dye fills your arteries, the arteries become visible on X-ray, revealing areas of blockage. - Other imaging tests. Your doctor may use ultrasound, a computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to study your arteries. These tests can often show hardening and narrowing of large arteries, as well as aneurysms and calcium deposits in the artery walls. Lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and exercising, are often the most appropriate treatment for atherosclerosis. Sometimes, medication or surgical procedures may be recommended as well. Medications Various drugs can slow - or even reverse - the effects of atherosclerosis. Here are some common choices: - Cholesterol medications. Aggressively lowering your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the \"bad\" cholesterol, can slow, stop or even reverse the buildup of fatty deposits in your arteries. Boosting your high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the \"good\" cholesterol, may help, too. Your doctor can choose from a range of cholesterol medications, including drugs known as statins and fibrates. In addition to lowering cholesterol, statins have additional effects that help stabilize the lining of your heart arteries and prevent atherosclerosis. - Anti-platelet medications. Your doctor may prescribe anti-platelet medications, such as aspirin, to reduce the likelihood that platelets will clump in narrowed arteries, form a blood clot and cause further blockage. - Beta blocker medications. These medications are commonly used for coronary artery disease. They lower your heart rate and blood pressure, reducing the demand on your heart and often relieve symptoms of chest pain. Beta blockers reduce the risk of heart attacks and some heart rhythm problems. - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These medications may help slow the progression of atherosclerosis by lowering blood pressure and producing other beneficial effects on the heart arteries. ACE inhibitors can also reduce the risk of recurrent heart attacks. - Calcium channel blockers. These medications lower blood pressure and are sometimes used to treat angina. - Water pills (diuretics). High blood pressure is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. Diuretics lower blood pressure. - Other medications. Your doctor may suggest certain medications to control specific risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as diabetes. Sometimes specific medications to treat symptoms of atherosclerosis, such as leg pain during exercise, are prescribed. Surgical procedures Sometimes more aggressive treatment is needed to treat atherosclerosis. If you have severe symptoms or a blockage that threatens muscle or skin tissue survival, you may be a candidate for one of the following surgical procedures: - Angioplasty and stent placement. In this procedure, your doctor inserts a long, thin tube (catheter) into the blocked or narrowed part of your artery. A second catheter with a deflated balloon on its tip is then passed through the catheter to the narrowed area. The balloon is then inflated, compressing the deposits against your artery walls. A mesh tube (stent) is usually left in the artery to help keep the artery open. - Endarterectomy. In some cases, fatty deposits must be surgically removed from the walls of a narrowed artery. When the procedure is done on arteries in the neck (the carotid arteries), it's called a carotid endarterectomy. - Fibrinolytic therapy. If you have an artery that's blocked by a blood clot, your doctor may use a clot-dissolving drug to break it apart. - Bypass surgery. Your doctor may create a graft bypass using a vessel from another part of your body or a tube made of synthetic fabric. This allows blood to flow around the blocked or narrowed artery. Lifestyle changes can help you prevent or slow the progression of atherosclerosis. - Stop smoking. Smoking damages your arteries. If you smoke or use tobacco in any form, quitting is the best way to halt the progression of atherosclerosis and reduce your risk of complications. - Exercise most days of the week. Regular exercise can condition your muscles to use oxygen more efficiently. Physical activity can also improve circulation and promote development of new blood vessels that form a natural bypass around obstructions (collateral vessels). Exercise helps lower blood pressure and reduces your risk of diabetes. Aim to exercise at least 30 minutes most days of the week. If you can't fit it all into one session, try breaking it up into 10-minute intervals. You can take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk around the block during your lunch hour, or do some situps or pushups while watching television. - Eat healthy foods. A heart-healthy diet based on fruits, vegetables and whole grains - and low in refined carbohydrates, sugars, saturated fat and sodium - can help you control your weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar. Try substituting whole-grain bread in place of white bread; grabbing an apple, a banana or carrot sticks as a snack; and reading nutrition labels as a guide to controlling the amount of salt and fat you eat. Use monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil, and reduce or eliminate sugar and sugar substitutes. - Lose extra pounds and maintain a healthy weight. If you're overweight, losing as few as 5 to 10 pounds (about 2.3 to 4.5 kilograms) can help reduce your risk of high blood pressure and high cholesterol, two of the major risk factors for developing atherosclerosis. Losing weight helps reduce your risk of diabetes or control your condition if you already have diabetes. - Manage stress. Reduce stress as much as possible. Practice healthy techniques for managing stress, such as muscle relaxation and deep breathing. If you have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes or another chronic disease, work with your doctor to manage the condition and promote overall health. It's thought that some foods and herbal supplements can help reduce your high cholesterol level and high blood pressure, two major risk factors for developing atherosclerosis. With your doctor's OK, you might consider these supplements and products: - Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) - Barley - Beta-sitosterol (found in oral supplements and some margarines, such as Promise Activ) - Black tea - Blond psyllium (found in seed husk and products such as Metamucil) - Calcium - Cocoa - Cod liver oil - Coenzyme Q10 - Fish oil - Folic acid - Garlic - Green tea - Oat bran (found in oatmeal and whole oats) - Sitostanol (found in oral supplements and some margarines, such as Benecol) - Vitamin C Talk to your doctor before adding any of these supplements to your atherosclerosis treatment. Some supplements can interact with medications, causing harmful side effects. You can also practice relaxation techniques, such as yoga or deep breathing, to help you relax and reduce your stress level. These practices can temporarily reduce your blood pressure, reducing your risk of developing atherosclerosis."

Be sure to let your doctor know if you have new or worsening symptoms. Emotional Issues and Support Having an atherosclerosis-related disease may cause fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Talk about how you feel with your doctor. Talking to a professional counselor also can help. If you're very depressed, your doctor may recommend medicines or other treatments that can improve your quality of life. Community resources are available to help you learn more about atherosclerosis. Contact your local public health departments, hospitals, and local chapters of national health organizations to learn more about available resources in your area. Talk about your lifestyle changes with your family and friends\u2014whoever can provide support or needs to understand why you're changing your habits. Family and friends may be able to help you make lifestyle changes. For example, they can help you plan healthier meals. Because atherosclerosis tends to run in families, your lifestyle changes may help many of your family members too."

        "document": "What is Atherosclerosis?: Espaol  Atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to your heart and other parts of your body.  Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows your arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your organs and other parts of your body.  Atherosclerosis can lead to serious problems, including heart attack, stroke, or even death.  Atherosclerosis    Atherosclerosis-Related Diseases  Atherosclerosis can affect any artery in the body, including arteries in the heart, brain, arms, legs, pelvis, and kidneys. As a result, different diseases may develop based on which arteries are affected.  Coronary Heart Disease  Coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease, occurs when plaque builds up in the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.  Plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. Plaque buildup also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow.  If blood flow to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, you may have angina (chest pain or discomfort) or a heart attack.  Plaque also can form in the heart's smallest arteries. This disease is called coronary microvascular disease (MVD). In coronary MVD, plaque doesn't cause blockages in the arteries as it does in CHD.  Carotid Artery Disease  Carotid (ka-ROT-id) artery disease occurs if plaque builds up in the arteries on each side of your neck (the carotid arteries). These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your brain. If blood flow to your brain is reduced or blocked, you may have a stroke.  Peripheral Artery Disease  Peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) occurs if plaque builds up in the major arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to your legs, arms, and pelvis.  If blood flow to these parts of your body is reduced or blocked, you may have numbness, pain, and, sometimes, dangerous infections.  Chronic Kidney Disease  Chronic kidney disease can occur if plaque builds up in the renal arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your kidneys.  Over time, chronic kidney disease causes a slow loss of kidney function. The main function of the kidneys is to remove waste and extra water from the body.  Overview  The cause of atherosclerosis isn't known. However, certain traits, conditions, or habits may raise your risk for the disease. These conditions are known as risk factors.  You can control some risk factors, such as lack of physical activity, smoking, and an unhealthy diet. Others you can't control, such as age and a family history of heart disease.  Some people who have atherosclerosis have no signs or symptoms. They may not be diagnosed until after a heart attack or stroke.  The main treatment for atherosclerosis is lifestyle changes. You also may need medicines and medical procedures. These treatments, along with ongoing medical care, can help you live a healthier life.  Outlook  Improved treatments have reduced the number of deaths from atherosclerosis-related diseases. These treatments also have improved the quality of life for people who have these diseases. However, atherosclerosis remains a common health problem.  You may be able to prevent or delay atherosclerosis and the diseases it can cause. Making lifestyle changes and getting ongoing care can help you avoid the problems of atherosclerosis and live a long, healthy life."

        "query": "how to prevent atherosclerosis",
        "document": "Atherosclerosis (WHO IS AT RISK): The exact cause of atherosclerosis isn't known. However, certain traits, conditions, or habits may raise your risk for the disease. These conditions are known as risk factors. The more risk factors you have, the more likely it is that you'll develop atherosclerosis. You can control most risk factors and help prevent or delay atherosclerosis. Other risk factors can't be controlled. Major Risk Factors Unhealthy blood cholesterol levels. This includes high LDL cholesterol (sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol) and low HDL cholesterol (sometimes called \"good\" cholesterol). High blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time. If you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercury\u2014the units used to measure blood pressure.) Smoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels, raise cholesterol levels, and raise blood pressure. Smoking also doesn't allow enough oxygen to reach the body's tissues. Insulin resistance. This condition occurs if the body can't use its insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where it's used as an energy source. Insulin resistance may lead to diabetes. Diabetes. With this disease, the body's blood sugar level is too high because the body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use its insulin properly. Overweight or obesity. The terms \"overweight\" and \"obesity\" refer to body weight that's greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height. Lack of physical activity. A lack of physical activity can worsen other risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, and overweight and obesity. Unhealthy diet. An unhealthy diet can raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Foods that are high in saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and sugar can worsen other atherosclerosis risk factors. Older age. As you get older, your risk for atherosclerosis increases. Genetic or lifestyle factors cause plaque to build up in your arteries as you age. By the time you're middle-aged or older, enough plaque has built up to cause signs or symptoms. In men, the risk increases after age 45. In women, the risk increases after age 55. Family history of early heart disease. Your risk for atherosclerosis increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with heart disease before 65 years of age. Although age and a family history of early heart disease are risk factors, it doesn't mean that you'll develop atherosclerosis if you have one or both. Controlling other risk factors often can lessen genetic influences and prevent atherosclerosis, even in older adults. Studies show that an increasing number of children and youth are at risk for atherosclerosis. This is due to a number of causes, including rising childhood obesity rates. Emerging Risk Factors Scientists continue to study other possible risk factors for atherosclerosis. High levels of a protein called C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood may raise the risk for atherosclerosis and heart attack. High levels of CRP are a sign of inflammation in the body. Inflammation is the body's response to injury or infection. Damage to the arteries' inner walls seems to trigger inflammation and help plaque grow. People who have low CRP levels may develop atherosclerosis at a slower rate than people who have high CRP levels. Research is under way to find out whether reducing inflammation and lowering CRP levels also can reduce the risk for atherosclerosis. High levels of triglycerides (tri-GLIH-seh-rides) in the blood also may raise the risk for atherosclerosis, especially in women. Triglycerides are a type of fat. Studies are under way to find out whether genetics may play a role in atherosclerosis risk. Other Factors That Affect Atherosclerosis Other factors also may raise your risk for atherosclerosis, such as: Sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a disorder that causes one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep. Untreated sleep apnea can raise your risk for high blood pressure, diabetes, and even a heart attack or stroke. Stress. Research shows that the most commonly reported \"trigger\" for a heart attack is an emotionally upsetting event, especially one involving anger. Alcohol. Heavy drinking can damage the heart muscle and worsen other risk factors for atherosclerosis. Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day. Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day."

        "document": "Neonatal conjunctivitis: Conjunctivitis is swelling or infection of the membrane that lines the eyelids and covers the white part of the eye.   Conjunctivitis may occur in a newborn child. Swollen or inflamed eyes are most commonly caused by:     - A blocked tear duct   - Eye drops with antibiotics, given right after birth   - Infection by bacteria or viruses      Bacteria that normally live in a woman's vagina may be passed to the baby during childbirth. More serious eye damage may be caused by:      - Gonorrhea and chlamydia: These are infections spread from sexual contact.   - The viruses that cause genital and oral herpes: These may lead to severe eye damage. Herpes eye infections are less common than those caused by gonorrhea and chlamydia.      The mother may not have symptoms at the time of delivery. She still may carry bacteria or viruses that can cause this problem. Infected newborn infants develop drainage from the eyes within 1 day to 2 weeks after birth.   The eyelids become puffy, red, and tender.   There may be watery, bloody, or thick pus-like drainage from the infant's eyes. The health care provider will perform an eye exam on the baby. If the eye does not appear normal, the following tests may be done:     - Culture of the drainage from the eye to look for bacteria or viruses   - Slit-lamp exam to look for damage to the surface of the eyeball Eye swelling that is caused by the eye drops given at birth should go away on its own.   For a blocked tear duct, gentle warm massage between the eye and nasal area may help. This is most often tried before starting antibiotics. Surgery may be needed if a blocked tear duct has not cleared up by the time the baby is 1 year old.    Antibiotics are often needed for eye infections caused by bacteria. Eye drops and ointments may also be used. Salt water eye drops may be used to remove sticky yellow drainage.   Special antiviral eye drops or ointments are used for herpes infections of the eye. Quick diagnosis and treatment usually leads to good outcomes. Complications may include:     - Blindness   - Inflammation of the iris   - Scar or hole in the cornea -- the clear structure that is over the colored part of the eye (the iris) Talk to your provider if you have given birth (or expect to give birth) in a place where antibiotic or silver nitrate drops are not routinely placed in the infant's eyes. An example would be having an unsupervised birth at home. This is very important if you have or are at risk for any sexually transmitted disease. Pregnant women should get treatment for diseases spread through sexual contact to prevent newborn conjunctivitis caused by these infections.    Putting eye drops into all infants' eyes in the delivery room right after birth can help prevent many infections. (Most states have laws requiring this treatment.)

The following actions can also help prevent hypoglycemia:Knowing your blood glucose level can help you decide how much medicine to take, what food to eat, and how physically active to be. To find out your blood glucose level, check yourself with a blood glucose meter as often as your doctor advises.Hypoglycemia unawareness. Sometimes people with diabetes don\u2019t feel or recognize the symptoms of hypoglycemia, a problem called hypoglycemia unawareness. If you have had hypoglycemia without feeling any symptoms, you may need to check your blood glucose more often so you know when you need to treat your hypoglycemia or take steps to prevent it. Be sure to check your blood glucose before you drive.If you have hypoglycemia unawareness or have hypoglycemia often, ask your health care provider about a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). A CGM checks your blood glucose level at regular times throughout the day and night. CGMs can tell you if your blood glucose is falling quickly and sound an alarm if your blood glucose falls too low. CGM alarms can wake you up if you have hypoglycemia during sleep.Your meal plan is key to preventing hypoglycemia. Eat regular meals and snacks with the correct amount of carbohydrates to help keep your blood glucose level from going too low. Also, if you drink alcoholic beverages, it\u2019s best to eat some food at the same time.Physical activity can lower your blood glucose during the activity and for hours afterward. To help prevent hypoglycemia, you may need to check your blood glucose before, during, and after physical activity and adjust your medicine or carbohydrate intake. For example, you might eat a snack before being physically active or decrease your insulin dose as directed by your health care provider to keep your blood glucose from dropping too low.Tell your health care team if you have had hypoglycemia. Your health care team may adjust your diabetes medicines or other aspects of your management plan. Learn about balancing your medicines, eating plan, and physical activity to prevent hypoglycemia.

        "document": "Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that makes it hard to tell the difference between what is real and not real.   It also makes it hard to think clearly, have normal emotional responses, and act normally in social situations. Schizophrenia is a complex illness. Mental health experts are not sure what causes it. Genes may play a role.   Schizophrenia occurs in just as many men as women. It usually begins in the teen or young adult years, but it may begin later in life. In women, it tends to begin later and is a milder condition.   Schizophrenia in children usually begins after age 5. Childhood schizophrenia is rare and can be hard to tell apart from other developmental problems, such as autism. Symptoms usually develop slowly over months or years. The person may have many symptoms, or only a few.   People with schizophrenia may have trouble keeping friends and working. They may also have problems with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts or behaviors.   Early symptoms may include:     - Irritable or tense feeling   - Trouble concentrating   - Trouble sleeping      As the illness continues, the person may have problems with thinking, emotions, and behavior, including:     - Hearing or seeing things that are not there (hallucinations)   - Isolation   - Reduced emotions in tone of voice or expression of face   - Problems with understanding and making decisions   - Problems paying attention and following through with activities   - Strongly held beliefs that are not real (delusions)   - Talking in a way that does not make sense   - Thoughts that \"jump\" between different topics (loose associations) There are no medical tests to diagnose schizophrenia. A psychiatrist should examine the person and make the diagnosis. The diagnosis is made based on an interview of the person and family members.    The psychiatrist will ask:     - How long symptoms have lasted   - How the person's ability to function has changed   - What the person's developmental background was like   - About the person's genetic and family history   - How well medicines have worked   - Whether the person has problems with substance abuse   - About any other medical conditions the person has     Brain scans (such as CT or MRI) and blood tests may help rule out other conditions that have similar symptoms. During an episode of schizophrenia, the person may need to stay in the hospital for safety reasons.   MEDICINES    Antipsychotic drugs are the most effective treatment for schizophrenia. They change the balance of chemicals in the brain and can help control symptoms.   These drugs can cause side effects, but many side effects can be managed. Side effects should not prevent the person from getting treated for this serious condition.   Common side effects from antipsychotics may include:     - Dizziness   - Feelings of restlessness or jitteriness   - Sleepiness (sedation)   - Slowed movements   - Tremor   - Weight gain      Long-term use of antipsychotics may increase the risk of a movement disorder called tardive dyskinesia. This condition causes repeated movements that the person cannot control. Call the health care provider right away if you think you or your family member may have this condition due to the medicine.   When schizophrenia does not improve with antipsychotics, other medicines may be tried.   Schizophrenia is a life-long illness. Most people with this condition need to stay on antipsychotics for life.   SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND THERAPIES    Support therapy may be helpful for many people with schizophrenia. Behavioral techniques, such as social skills training, can help the person function better in social and work situations. Job training and relationship-building classes are also important.   Family members and caregivers are very important during treatment. Therapy can teach important skills, such as:     - Coping with symptoms that continue, even while taking medicines   - Following a healthy lifestyle, including getting enough sleep and staying away from recreational drugs   - Taking medicines correctly and managing side effects   - Watching for the return of symptoms, and knowing what to do when they return   - Getting the right support services Outlook is hard to predict. Most of the time, symptoms improve with medicines. But many people may have trouble functioning. They are at risk of repeated episodes, especially during the early stages of the illness.   People with schizophrenia may need housing, job training, and other community support programs. Those with the most severe forms of this disorder may not be able to live alone. They may need to live in group homes or other long-term, structured residences.   Symptoms are very likely to return when medicine is stopped. Having schizophrenia increases the risk of:     - Developing a problem with alcohol or drugs. Using these substances increases the chances that symptoms will return.   - Physical illness. This is due to an inactive lifestyle and side effects of medicines.   - Suicide Call your provider if you (or another family member):     - Hear voices telling you to hurt yourself or others   - Have the urge to hurt yourself or others   - Feel scared or overwhelmed   - See things that are not really there   - Feel that you cannot leave the house   - Feel that you are not able to care for yourself Schizophrenia cannot be prevented.   Symptoms may be prevented by taking medicine exactly as the doctor instructed. Symptoms are likely to return if medicine is stopped.   Changing or stopping medicines should only be done by the doctor who prescribed them. Updated by: Fred K. Berger, MD, addiction and forensic psychiatrist, Scripps Memorial Hospital, La Jolla, CA.

The following steps can help you not only prevent but also recover from a heart attack: - Avoid smoke. The most important thing you can do to improve your heart's health is to not smoke. Also, avoid being around secondhand smoke. If you need to quit, ask your doctor for help. - Control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. If one or both of these is high, your doctor can prescribe changes to your diet and medications. Ask your doctor how often you need to have your blood pressure and cholesterol levels monitored. - Get regular medical checkups. Some of the major risk factors for heart attack - high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes - cause no symptoms early on. Your doctor can perform tests to check for these conditions and help you manage them, if necessary. - Exercise regularly. Regular exercise helps improve heart muscle function after a heart attack and helps prevent a heart attack by helping you to control your weight, diabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure. Exercise needn't be vigorous. Walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week can improve your health. - Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight strains your heart and can contribute to high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. - Eat a heart-healthy diet. Saturated fat, trans fats and cholesterol in your diet can narrow arteries to your heart, and too much salt can raise blood pressure. Eat a heart-healthy diet that includes lean proteins, such as fish and beans, plenty of fruits and vegetables and whole grains. - Manage diabetes. High blood sugar is damaging to your heart. Regular exercise, eating well and losing weight all help to keep blood sugar levels at more-desirable levels. Many people also need medication to manage their diabetes. - Control stress. Reduce stress in your day-to-day activities. Rethink workaholic habits and find healthy ways to minimize or deal with stressful events in your life. - If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger."

Medicines and fluids pass through this IV.   - You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain.   - You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. In that case, you will be given another medicine that prevents blood clots.   - Dangerous abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) may be treated with medicine or electric shocks.       EMERGENCY PROCEDURES    Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart.      - Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment. It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack.   - A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again.      You may be given drugs to break up the clot. This is called thrombolytic therapy. It is best if these drugs are given soon after the onset of symptoms, usually no later than 12 hours after it and ideally within 30 minutes of arriving to the hospital.   Some people may also have heart bypass surgery to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. This procedure is also called coronary artery bypass grafting and/or open heart surgery.    TREATMENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK    After several days, you will be discharged from the hospital.   You will likely need to take medicines, some for the rest of your life. Always talk to your provider before stopping or changing how you take any medicines. Stopping certain medicines can be deadly.    While under the care of your health care team, you will learn:     - How to take medicines to treat your heart problem and prevent more heart attacks   - How to eat a heart-healthy diet   - How to be active and exercise safely   - What to do when you have chest pain   - How to stop smoking      Strong emotions are common after a heart attack.     - You may feel sad   - You may feel anxious and worry about being careful about everything you do      All of these feelings are normal. They go away for most people after 2 or 3 weeks.   You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital to go home.   Most people who have had a heart attack take part in a cardiac rehabilitation program."

These drugs, also called clotbusters, help dissolve a blood clot that's blocking blood flow to your heart. The earlier you receive a thrombolytic drug after a heart attack, the greater the chance you'll survive and with less heart damage. - Antiplatelet agents. Emergency room doctors may give you other drugs to help prevent new clots and keep existing clots from getting larger. These include medications, such as clopidogrel (Plavix) and others, called platelet aggregation inhibitors. - Other blood-thinning medications. You'll likely be given other medications, such as heparin, to make your blood less \"sticky\" and less likely to form clots. Heparin is given intravenously or by an injection under your skin. - Pain relievers. You may receive a pain reliever, such as morphine, to ease your discomfort. - Nitroglycerin. This medication, used to treat chest pain (angina), can help improve blood flow to the heart by widening (dilating) the blood vessels. - Beta blockers. These medications help relax your heart muscle, slow your heartbeat and decrease blood pressure, making your heart's job easier. Beta blockers can limit the amount of heart muscle damage and prevent future heart attacks. - ACE inhibitors. These drugs lower blood pressure and reduce stress on the heart. Surgical and other procedures In addition to medications, you may undergo one of the following procedures to treat your heart attack: - Coronary angioplasty and stenting. Doctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) that's passed through an artery, usually in your leg or groin, to a blocked artery in your heart. If you've had a heart attack, this procedure is often done immediately after a cardiac catheterization, a procedure used to locate blockages. This catheter is equipped with a special balloon that, once in position, is briefly inflated to open a blocked coronary artery. A metal mesh stent may be inserted into the artery to keep it open long term, restoring blood flow to the heart. Depending on your condition, your doctor may opt to place a stent coated with a slow-releasing medication to help keep your artery open. - Coronary artery bypass surgery. In some cases, doctors may perform emergency bypass surgery at the time of a heart attack. If possible, your doctor may suggest that you have bypass surgery after your heart has had time - about three to seven days - to recover from your heart attack. Bypass surgery involves sewing veins or arteries in place beyond a blocked or narrowed coronary artery, allowing blood flow to the heart to bypass the narrowed section. Once blood flow to your heart is restored and your condition is stable, you're likely to remain in the hospital for several days."

        "query": "what are autoimmune blood disorders",
        "document": "Autoimmune disorders: An autoimmune disorder occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. There are more than 80 types of autoimmune disorders. The blood cells in the body's immune system help protect against harmful substances. Examples include bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces antibodies against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances.   When you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and antigens. As a result, the body sets off a reaction that destroys normal tissues.    The exact cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system. This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders.   An autoimmune disorder may result in:     - The destruction of body tissue   - Abnormal growth of an organ   - Changes in organ function      An autoimmune disorder may affect one or more organ or tissue types. Areas often affected by autoimmune disorders include:     - Blood vessels   - Connective tissues   - Endocrine glands such as the thyroid or pancreas   - Joints   - Muscles   - Red blood cells   - Skin      A person may have more than one autoimmune disorder at the same time. Common autoimmune disorders include:     - Addison disease   - Celiac disease - sprue (gluten-sensitive enteropathy)   - Dermatomyositis   - Graves disease   - Hashimoto thyroiditis   - Multiple sclerosis   - Myasthenia gravis   - Pernicious anemia   - Reactive arthritis   - Rheumatoid arthritis   - Sj\u00f6gren syndrome   - Systemic lupus erythematosus   - Type I diabetes Symptoms will vary based on the type and location of the faulty immune response. Common symptoms include:     - Fatigue   - Fever   - General ill-feeling (malaise)   - Joint pain   - Rash The health care provider will do a physical exam. Signs depend on the type of disease.   Tests that may be done to diagnose an autoimmune disorder include:     - Antinuclear antibody tests   - Autoantibody tests   - CBC   - Comprehensive metabolic panel   - C-reactive protein (CRP)   - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)   - Urinalysis The goals of treatment are to:     - Reduce symptoms   - Control the autoimmune process   - Maintain the body's ability to fight disease      Treatments will depend on your disease and symptoms. Types of treatments include:     - Supplements to replace a substance that the body lacks, such as thyroid hormone, vitamin B12, or insulin, due to the autoimmune disease   - Blood transfusions if blood is affected   - Physical therapy to help with movement if the bones, joints, or muscles are affected      Many people take medicines to reduce the immune system's abnormal response. These are often called immunosuppressive medicines. Examples include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and nonsteroid drugs such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, sirolimus, or tacrolimus. Targeted drugs called tumor necrosis factor (TFN) blockers can be used for some diseases. The outcome depends on the disease. Most autoimmune diseases are chronic, but many can be controlled with treatment.   Symptoms of autoimmune disorders can come and go. When symptoms get worse, it is called a flare-up. Complications depend on the disease. Medicines used to suppress the immune system can cause severe side effects, such as higher risk of infections. Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of an autoimmune disorder. There is no known prevention for most autoimmune disorders. Updated by: Laura J.

        "query": "what are known causes of bipolar disorder",
        "document": "Bipolar disorder: Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly. Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any. Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy). Bipolar disorder care at Mayo Clinic There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life. - Bipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis).   - Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode.   - Cyclothymic disorder. You've had at least two years - or one year in children and teenagers - of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression).   - Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke. Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment. Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization. Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms: - Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired   - Increased activity, energy or agitation   - Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria)   - Decreased need for sleep   - Unusual talkativeness   - Racing thoughts   - Distractibility   - Poor decision-making - for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments Major depressive episode A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms: - Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability)   - Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all - or almost all - activities   - Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression)   - Either insomnia or sleeping too much   - Either restlessness or slowed behavior   - Fatigue or loss of energy   - Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt   - Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness   - Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide Other features of bipolar disorder Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons. Symptoms in children and teens Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It's often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. The most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings. When to see a doctor Despite the mood extremes, people with bipolar disorder often don't recognize how much their emotional instability disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones and don't get the treatment they need. And if you're like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. However, this euphoria is always followed by an emotional crash that can leave you depressed, worn out - and perhaps in financial, legal or relationship trouble. If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your doctor or mental health professional. Bipolar disorder doesn't get better on its own. Getting treatment from a mental health professional with experience in bipolar disorder can help you get your symptoms under control. When to get emergency help Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with bipolar disorder. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or call a suicide hotline number - in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room. The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors may be involved, such as: - Biological differences. People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes.   - Genetics. Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing bipolar disorder. Factors that may increase the risk of developing bipolar disorder or act as a trigger for the first episode include: - Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with bipolar disorder   - Periods of high stress, such as the death of a loved one or other traumatic event   - Drug or alcohol abuse Left untreated, bipolar disorder can result in serious problems that affect every area of your life, such as: - Problems related to drug and alcohol use   - Suicide or suicide attempts   - Legal or financial problems   - Damaged relationships   - Poor work or school performance Co-occurring conditions If you have bipolar disorder, you may also have another health condition that needs to be treated along with bipolar disorder. Some conditions can worsen bipolar disorder symptoms or make treatment less successful. Examples include: - Anxiety disorders   - Eating disorders   - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)   - Alcohol or drug problems   - Physical health problems, such as heart disease, thyroid problems, headaches or obesity To determine if you have bipolar disorder, your evaluation may include: - Physical exam. Your doctor may do a physical exam and lab tests to identify any medical problems that could be causing your symptoms. - Psychiatric assessment. Your doctor may refer you to a psychiatrist, who will talk to you about your thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may also fill out a psychological self-assessment or questionnaire. With your permission, family members or close friends may be asked to provide information about your symptoms. - Mood charting. You may be asked to keep a daily record of your moods, sleep patterns or other factors that could help with diagnosis and finding the right treatment. - Criteria for bipolar disorder. Your psychiatrist may compare your symptoms with the criteria for bipolar and related disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Diagnosis in children Although diagnosis of children and teenagers with bipolar disorder includes the same criteria that are used for adults, symptoms in children and teens often have different patterns and may not fit neatly into the diagnostic categories. Also, children who have bipolar disorder are frequently also diagnosed with other mental health conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or behavior problems, which can make diagnosis more complicated. Referral to a child psychiatrist with experience in bipolar disorder is recommended. Treatment is best guided by a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions (psychiatrist) who is skilled in treating bipolar and related disorders. You may have a treatment team that also includes a psychologist, social worker and psychiatric nurse. Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition. Treatment is directed at managing symptoms. Depending on your needs, treatment may include: - Medications. Often, you'll need to start taking medications to balance your moods right away. - Continued treatment. Bipolar disorder requires lifelong treatment with medications, even during periods when you feel better. People who skip maintenance treatment are at high risk of a relapse of symptoms or having minor mood changes turn into full-blown mania or depression. - Day treatment programs. Your doctor may recommend a day treatment program. These programs provide the support and counseling you need while you get symptoms under control. - Substance abuse treatment. If you have problems with alcohol or drugs, you'll also need substance abuse treatment. Otherwise, it can be very difficult to manage bipolar disorder. - Hospitalization. Your doctor may recommend hospitalization if you're behaving dangerously, you feel suicidal or you become detached from reality (psychotic). Getting psychiatric treatment at a hospital can help keep you calm and safe and stabilize your mood, whether you're having a manic or major depressive episode. The primary treatments for bipolar disorder include medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy) to control symptoms, and also may include education and support groups. Medications A number of medications are used to treat bipolar disorder. The types and doses of medications prescribed are based on your particular symptoms. Medications may include: - Mood stabilizers. You'll typically need mood-stabilizing medication to control manic or hypomanic episodes. Examples of mood stabilizers include lithium (Lithobid), valproic acid (Depakene), divalproex sodium (Depakote), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Equetro, others) and lamotrigine (Lamictal). - Antipsychotics. If symptoms of depression or mania persist in spite of treatment with other medications, adding an antipsychotic drug such as olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal), quetiapine (Seroquel), aripiprazole (Abilify), ziprasidone (Geodon), lurasidone (Latuda) or asenapine (Saphris) may help. Your doctor may prescribe some of these medications alone or along with a mood stabilizer. - Antidepressants. Your doctor may add an antidepressant to help manage depression. Because an antidepressant can sometimes trigger a manic episode, it's usually prescribed along with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. - Antidepressant-antipsychotic. The medication Symbyax combines the antidepressant fluoxetine and the antipsychotic olanzapine. It works as a depression treatment and a mood stabilizer. - Anti-anxiety medications. Benzodiazepines may help with anxiety and improve sleep, but are usually used on a short-term basis. Finding the right medication Finding the right medication or medications for you will likely take some trial and error. If one doesn't work well for you, there are several others to try. This process requires patience, as some medications need weeks to months to take full effect. Generally only one medication is changed at a time so that your doctor can identify which medications work to relieve your symptoms with the least bothersome side effects. Medications also may need to be adjusted as your symptoms change. Side effects Mild side effects often improve as you find the right medications and doses that work for you, and your body adjusts to the medications. Talk to your doctor or mental health professional if you have bothersome side effects. Don't make changes or stop taking your medications. If you stop your medication, you may experience withdrawal effects or your symptoms may worsen or return. You may become very depressed, feel suicidal, or go into a manic or hypomanic episode. If you think you need to make a change, call your doctor. Medications and pregnancy A number of medications for bipolar disorder can be associated with birth defects and can pass through breast milk to your baby. Certain medications, such as valproic acid and divalproex sodium, should not be used during pregnancy. Also, birth control medications may lose effectiveness when taken along with certain bipolar disorder medications. Discuss treatment options with your doctor before you become pregnant, if possible. If you're taking medication to treat your bipolar disorder and think you may be pregnant, talk to your doctor right away. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy is a vital part of bipolar disorder treatment and can be provided in individual, family or group settings. Several types of therapy may be helpful. These include: - Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT). IPSRT focuses on the stabilization of daily rhythms, such as sleeping, waking and mealtimes. A consistent routine allows for better mood management. People with bipolar disorder may benefit from establishing a daily routine for sleep, diet and exercise. - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The focus is identifying unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and replacing them with healthy, positive ones. CBT can help identify what triggers your bipolar episodes. You also learn effective strategies to manage stress and to cope with upsetting situations. - Psychoeducation. Learning about bipolar disorder (psychoeducation) can help you and your loved ones understand the condition. Knowing what's going on can help you get the best support, identify issues, make a plan to prevent relapse and stick with treatment. - Family-focused therapy. Family support and communication can help you stick with your treatment plan and help you and your loved ones recognize and manage warning signs of mood swings. Other treatment options Depending on your needs, other treatments may be added to your depression therapy. During electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), electrical currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure. ECT seems to cause changes in brain chemistry that can reverse symptoms of certain mental illnesses. ECT may be an option for bipolar treatment if you don't get better with medications, can't take antidepressants for health reasons such as pregnancy or are at high risk of suicide. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is being investigated as an option for those who haven't responded to antidepressants. Treatment in children and teenagers Treatments for children and teenagers are generally decided on a case-by-case basis, depending on symptoms, medication side effects and other factors. Generally, treatment includes: - Medications. Children and teens with bipolar disorder are often prescribed the same types of medications as those used in adults. There's less research on the safety and effectiveness of bipolar medications in children than in adults, so treatment decisions are often based on adult research. - Psychotherapy. Initial and long-term therapy can help keep symptoms from returning. Psychotherapy can help children and teens manage their routines, develop coping skills, address learning difficulties, resolve social problems, and help strengthen family bonds and communication. And, if needed, it can help treat substance abuse problems common in older children and teens with bipolar disorder. - Psychoeducation. Psychoeducation can include learning the symptoms of bipolar disorder and how they differ from behavior related to your child's developmental age, the situation and appropriate cultural behavior. Understanding about bipolar disorder can also help you support your child. - Support. Working with teachers and school counselors and encouraging support from family and friends can help identify services and encourage success. You'll probably need to make lifestyle changes to stop cycles of behavior that worsen your bipolar disorder. Here are some steps to take: - Quit drinking or using recreational drugs. One of the biggest concerns with bipolar disorder is the negative consequences of risk-taking behavior and drug or alcohol abuse. Get help if you have trouble quitting on your own. - Form healthy relationships. Surround yourself with people who are a positive influence. Friends and family members can provide support and help you watch for warning signs of mood shifts. - Create a healthy routine. Having a regular routine for sleeping, eating and physical activity can help balance your moods. Check with your doctor before starting any exercise program. Eat a healthy diet. If you take lithium, talk with your doctor about appropriate fluid and salt intake. If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor or mental health professional about what you can do. - Check first before taking other medications. Call the doctor who's treating you for bipolar disorder before you take medications prescribed by another doctor or any over-the-counter supplements or medications. Sometimes other medications trigger episodes of depression or mania or may interfere with medications you're taking for bipolar disorder. - Consider keeping a mood chart. Keeping a record of your daily moods, treatments, sleep, activities and feelings may help identify triggers, effective treatment options and when treatment needs to be adjusted. There isn't much research on alternative or complementary medicine - sometimes called integrative medicine - and bipolar disorder. Most of the studies are on major depression, so it isn't clear how these nontraditional approaches work for bipolar disorder. If you choose to use alternative or complementary medicine in addition to your physician-recommended treatment, take some precautions first: - Don't stop taking your prescribed medications or skip therapy sessions. Alternative or complementary medicine is not a substitute for regular medical care when it comes to treating bipolar disorder. - Be honest with your doctors and mental health professionals. Tell them exactly which alternative or complementary treatments you use or would like to try. - Be aware of potential dangers. Alternative and complementary products aren't regulated the way prescription drugs are. Just because it's natural doesn't mean it's safe. Before using alternative or complementary medicine, talk to your doctor about the risks, including possible serious interactions with medications."

        "query": "what are pancreatic enzymes?",
        "document": "Pancreatic cysts: Pancreatic cysts are saclike pockets of fluid on or in your pancreas, a large organ behind the stomach that produces hormones and enzymes that help digest food. Most pancreatic cysts aren't cancerous, and many don't cause symptoms. They're typically found during imaging testing for another problem. Some are actually noncancerous (benign) pockets of fluids lined with scar or inflammatory tissue, not the type of cells found in true cysts (pseudocysts). But some pancreatic cysts can be or can become cancerous. Your doctor might take a sample of the pancreatic cyst fluid to determine if cancer cells are present. Or your doctor might recommend monitoring a cyst over time for changes that indicate cancer. You may not have symptoms from pancreatic cysts, which are often found when imaging tests of the abdomen are done for another reason. When signs or symptoms of pancreatic cysts do occur, they typically include: - Persistent abdominal pain, which may radiate to your back   - A mass you can feel in your upper abdomen   - Nausea and vomiting When to see a doctor Rarely, cysts can become infected. See a doctor if you have a fever and persistent abdominal pain. A ruptured pseudocyst can be a medical emergency, but fortunately is rare. Fluid released by the pseudocyst can damage nearby blood vessels and cause massive bleeding. A ruptured pseudocyst can also cause infection of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis). Seek emergency medical treatment if you have signs or symptoms of internal bleeding and shock, including: - Fainting   - Severe abdominal pain   - Decreased consciousness   - Weak and rapid heartbeat   - Vomiting of blood The cause of most pancreatic cysts is unknown. Some cysts are associated with rare illnesses including von Hippel-Lindau disease, a genetic disorder that can affect the pancreas and other organs. Pseudocysts often follow a bout of a painful condition in which digestive enzymes become prematurely active and irritate the pancreas (pancreatitis). Pseudocysts can also result from injury to the abdomen, such as from a car accident. Heavy alcohol use and gallstones are risk factors for pancreatitis, and pancreatitis is a risk factor for pseudocysts. Abdominal injury is also a risk factor for pseudocysts. Pancreatic cysts are diagnosed more often than in the past because improved imaging technology finds them more readily. Many pancreatic cysts are found during abdominal scans for other problems. The main challenge in diagnosis is to determine whether the cyst might become cancerous. These procedures are often used to help with diagnosis and treatment planning: - Medical history. Previous abdominal injury or pancreatitis might indicate a pseudocyst. - CT scan. This imaging test can provide detailed information about the size and structure of a pancreatic cyst. - MRI scan. This imaging test can highlight subtle details of a pancreatic cyst, including whether it has any components that suggest a higher risk of cancer. - Endoscopic ultrasound. This test, like MRI, can provide a detailed image of the cyst. Also, fluid can be collected from the cyst for analysis in a laboratory for possible signs of cancer. The characteristics and location of the pancreatic cyst, with your age and sex, can help doctors pinpoint the type of cyst you have: - Serous cystadenoma can become large enough to displace nearby organs, causing abdominal pain and a feeling of fullness. Serous cystadenomas occur most frequently in women older than 60 and only rarely become cancerous. - Mucinous cystadenoma is usually situated in the body or tail of the pancreas and occurs most often in middle-aged women. Mucinous cystadenoma is precancerous, which means it might become cancer if left untreated. Larger cysts might already be cancerous when found. - Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a growth in the main pancreatic duct or one of its side branches. IPMN may be precancerous or cancerous. It occurs most often in men and women older than 50. Depending on its location and other factors, IPMN may require surgical removal. - Papillary cystic tumor is usually situated in the body or tail of the pancreas and occurs most often in women younger than 35. Also known as papillary cystic neoplasm, it's rare and usually cancerous. - Cystic islet cell tumor is mostly solid but can have cystlike components. Cystic islet cell tumors are rare. They can be confused with other pancreatic cysts and may be precancerous or cancerous. Watchful waiting or treatment depends on the type of cyst you have, its size, its characteristics and whether it's causing symptoms. Watchful waiting A benign pseudocyst, even a large one, can be left alone as long as it isn't bothering you. Serous cystadenoma rarely becomes cancerous, so it also can be left alone unless it causes symptoms or grows. But all pancreatic cysts should be monitored. Drainage A pseudocyst that is causing bothersome symptoms or growing larger can be drained. A small flexible tube (endoscope) is passed through your mouth to your stomach and small intestine. The endoscope is equipped with an ultrasound probe (endoscopic ultrasound) and a needle to drain the cyst. Sometimes drainage through the skin is necessary. Surgery Surgery might be needed to remove an enlarged pseudocyst or a serous cystadenoma that's causing pain or other symptoms. Other types of pancreatic cysts generally require surgical removal because of the risk of cancer. A pseudocyst may recur if you have ongoing pancreatitis."

        "query": "what are pancreatic enzymes?",
        "document": "Pancreatic pseudocyst: A pancreatic pseudocyst is a fluid-filled sac in the abdomen. It may also contain tissue from the pancreas, enzymes, and blood. The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach. It produces chemicals (called enzymes) needed to digest food. It also produces the hormones insulin and glucagon.   Pancreatic pseudocysts most often develop after an episode of sudden, severe pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is sudden swelling of the pancreas. There are many causes of this problem.   This problem may sometimes occur:      - In someone with chronic swelling of the pancreas   - After trauma to the belly, more often in children     The cyst happens when the ducts (tubes) in the pancreas are damaged and fluid with enzymes cannot drain. Symptoms can occur within days to months after an attack of pancreatitis, and include:     - Bloating of the abdomen   - Constant pain or deep ache in the abdomen, which may also be felt in the back    - Difficulty eating and digesting food The health care provider may\u00a0feel your abdomen for a pseudocyst. It will feel like a lump in the middle or left upper abdomen.   Tests that may help diagnose pancreatic pseudocyst include:     - Abdominal CT scan   - Abdominal MRI   - Abdominal ultrasound   - Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) Treatment depends on the size of the pseudocyst and whether it is causing symptoms. Many pseudocysts go away on their own. Those that remain for more than 6 weeks and are larger than 5 cm in diameter often need treatment.   Possible treatments include:     - Drainage through the skin using a needle, most often guided by a CT scan   - Endoscopic-assisted drainage using an endoscope (a tube containing a camera and a light that is passed down into the stomach)   - Surgical drainage of the pseudocyst, which involves making a connection between the cyst and the stomach or small intestine. This may be done using a laparoscope. The outcome is generally good with treatment. It is important to make sure that it is not a pancreatic cancer that starts in a cyst, which has a worse outcome. Complications may include:     - A pancreatic abscess can develop if the pseudocyst becomes infected.   - The pseudocyst can break open (rupture), which can be a serious complication because shock and excess bleeding (hemorrhage) may develop.   - The pseudocyst may press down on (compress) nearby organs. Rupture of the pseudocyst is a medical emergency. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you develop symptoms of bleeding or shock, such as:     - Fainting   - Fever and chills   - Rapid heartbeat   - Severe abdominal pain The way to prevent pancreatic pseudocysts is by preventing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is caused by gallstones, it is often necessary to remove the gallbladder with surgery (cholecystectomy).    When pancreatitis occurs due to alcohol abuse, you must stop drinking alcohol to prevent future attacks.   When pancreatitis occurs due to high blood triglycerides, this condition should be treated.

        "query": "what are pancreatic enzymes?",
        "document": "Pancreatic cancer: Pancreatic cancer begins in the tissues of your pancreas - an organ in your abdomen that lies horizontally behind the lower part of your stomach. Your pancreas releases enzymes that aid digestion and hormones that help manage your blood sugar. Pancreatic cancer typically spreads rapidly to nearby organs. It is seldom detected in its early stages. But for people with pancreatic cysts or a family history of pancreatic cancer, some screening steps might help detect a problem early. One sign of pancreatic cancer is diabetes, especially when it occurs with weight loss, jaundice or pain in the upper abdomen that spreads to the back. Treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a combination of these. Pancreatic cancer care at Mayo Clinic Signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer often don't occur until the disease is advanced. They may include: - Pain in the upper abdomen that radiates to your back    - Loss of appetite or unintended weight loss   - Depression   - New-onset diabetes   - Blood clots   - Fatigue   - Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) When to see a doctor See your doctor if you experience unexplained weight loss or if you have persistent fatigue, abdominal pain, jaundice, or other signs and symptoms that bother you. Many conditions can cause these symptoms, so your doctor may check for these conditions as well as for pancreatic cancer. It's not clear what causes pancreatic cancer in most cases. Doctors have identified factors, such as smoking, that increase your risk of developing the disease. Understanding your pancreas Your pancreas is about 6 inches (15 centimeters) long and looks something like a pear lying on its side. It releases (secretes) hormones, including insulin, to help your body process sugar in the foods you eat. And it produces digestive juices to help your body digest food. How pancreatic cancer forms Pancreatic cancer occurs when cells in your pancreas develop mutations in their DNA. These mutations cause cells to grow uncontrollably and to continue living after normal cells would die. These accumulating cells can form a tumor. Untreated pancreatic cancer spreads to nearby organs and blood vessels. Most pancreatic cancer begins in the cells that line the ducts of the pancreas. This type of cancer is called pancreatic adenocarcinoma or pancreatic exocrine cancer. Rarely, cancer can form in the hormone-producing cells or the neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas. These types of cancer are called islet cell tumors, pancreatic endocrine cancer and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Factors that may increase your risk of pancreatic cancer include: - Chronic inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)   - Diabetes   - Family history of genetic syndromes that can increase cancer risk, including a BRCA2 gene mutation, Lynch syndrome and familial atypical mole-malignant melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome   - Family history of pancreatic cancer   - Smoking   - Obesity   - Older age, as most people are diagnosed after age 65 A large study demonstrated that the combination of smoking, long-standing diabetes and a poor diet increases the risk of pancreatic cancer beyond the risk of any one of these factors alone. As pancreatic cancer progresses, it can cause complications such as: -   Weight loss. A number of factors may cause weight loss in people with pancreatic cancer. The cancer itself may cause weight loss. Nausea and vomiting caused by cancer treatments or a tumor pressing on your stomach may make it difficult to eat. Or your body may have difficulty processing nutrients from food because your pancreas isn't making enough digestive juices.  Your doctor may recommend pancreatic enzyme supplements to aid in digestion. Try to maintain your weight by adding extra calories where you can and making mealtime as pleasant and relaxed as possible.    -   Jaundice. Pancreatic cancer that blocks the liver's bile duct can cause jaundice. Signs include yellow skin and eyes, dark-colored urine, and pale-colored stools. Jaundice usually occurs without abdominal pain.  Your doctor may recommend that a plastic or metal tube (stent) be placed inside the bile duct to hold it open. This is done with the help of a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). During ERCP an endoscope is passed down your throat, through your stomach and into the upper part of your small intestine. A dye is then injected into the pancreatic and bile ducts through a small hollow tube (catheter) that's passed through the endoscope. Finally, images are taken of the ducts.    -   Pain. A growing tumor may press on nerves in your abdomen, causing pain that can become severe. Pain medications can help you feel more comfortable. Radiation therapy might help stop tumor growth temporarily to give you some relief.  In severe cases, your doctor might recommend a procedure to inject alcohol into the nerves that control pain in your abdomen (celiac plexus block). This procedure stops the nerves from sending pain signals to your brain.    -   Bowel obstruction. Pancreatic cancer that grows into or presses on the first part of the small intestine (duodenum) can block the flow of digested food from your stomach into your intestines.  Your doctor may recommend a tube (stent) be placed in your small intestine to hold it open. Or surgery may be necessary to attach your stomach to a lower point in your intestines that isn't blocked by cancer. If your doctor suspects pancreatic cancer, he or she may have you undergo one or more of the following tests: - Imaging tests that create pictures of your internal organs. These tests help your doctors visualize your internal organs, including the pancreas. Techniques used to diagnose pancreatic cancer include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, sometimes, positron emission tomography (PET) scans. - Using a scope to create ultrasound pictures of your pancreas. An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) uses an ultrasound device to make images of your pancreas from inside your abdomen. The device is passed through a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) down your esophagus and into your stomach in order to obtain the images. - Removing a tissue sample for testing (biopsy). A biopsy is a procedure to remove a small sample of tissue for examination under a microscope. Your doctor may obtain a sample of tissue from the pancreas by inserting a needle through your skin and into your pancreas (fine-needle aspiration). Or he or she may remove a sample during EUS, guiding special tools into the pancreas. - Blood test. Your doctor may test your blood for specific proteins (tumor markers) shed by pancreatic cancer cells. One tumor marker test used in pancreatic cancer is called CA19-9. But the test isn't always reliable, and it isn't clear how best to use the CA19-9 test results. Some doctors measure your levels before, during and after treatment. If your doctor confirms a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, he or she tries to determine the extent (stage) of the cancer. Using information from staging tests, your doctor assigns your pancreatic cancer a stage, which helps determine what treatments are most likely to benefit to you. The stages of pancreatic cancer are indicated by Roman numerals ranging from 0 to IV. The lowest stages indicate that the cancer is confined to the pancreas. By stage IV, the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The cancer staging system continues to evolve and is becoming more complex as doctors improve cancer diagnosis and treatment. Your doctor uses your cancer stage to select the treatments that are right for you. Don't hesitate to ask your doctor about his or her experience with diagnosing pancreatic cancer. If you have any doubts, get a second opinion. Treatment for pancreatic cancer depends on the stage and location of the cancer as well as on your overall health and personal preferences. For most people, the first goal of pancreatic cancer treatment is to eliminate the cancer, when possible. When that isn't an option, the focus may be on improving your quality of life and preventing the cancer from growing or causing more harm. Treatment may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or a combination of these. When pancreatic cancer is advanced and these treatments aren't likely to offer a benefit, your doctor will offer symptom relief (palliative care) that makes you as comfortable as possible. Surgery Operations used in people with pancreatic cancer include: - Surgery for tumors in the pancreatic head. If your cancer is located in the head of the pancreas, you may consider an operation called a Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy). The Whipple procedure is technically difficult operation to remove the head of the pancreas, the first part of the small intestine (duodenum), the gallbladder and part of the bile duct. In some situations, part of the stomach and nearby lymph nodes may be removed as well. Your surgeon reconnects the remaining parts of your pancreas, stomach and intestines to allow you to digest food. - Surgery for tumors in the pancreatic body and tail. Surgery to remove the left side (body and tail) of the pancreas is called distal pancreatectomy. Your surgeon may also remove your spleen. - Surgery to remove the entire pancreas. In some people, the entire pancreas may need to be removed. This is called total pancreatectomy. You can live relatively normally without a pancreas but do need lifelong insulin and enzyme replacement. - Surgery for tumors affecting nearby blood vessels. Many people with advanced pancreatic cancer are not considered eligible for the Whipple procedure or other pancreatic surgeries if their tumors involve nearby blood vessels. At a very few medical centers in the United States, highly specialized and experienced surgeons will safely perform these operations with removal and reconstruction of parts of blood vessels in select patients. Each of these surgeries carries the risk of bleeding and infection. After surgery some people experience nausea and vomiting if the stomach has difficulty emptying (delayed gastric emptying). Expect a long recovery after any of these procedures. You'll spend several days in the hospital and then recover for several weeks at home. Extensive research shows pancreatic cancer surgery tends to cause fewer complications when done by highly experienced surgeons at centers that do many of these operations. Don't hesitate to ask about your surgeon's and hospital's experience with pancreatic cancer surgery. If you have any doubts, get a second opinion. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to help kill cancer cells. These drugs can be injected into a vein or taken orally. You may receive one chemotherapy drug or a combination of them. Chemotherapy can also be combined with radiation therapy (chemoradiation). Chemoradiation is typically used to treat cancer that has spread beyond the pancreas, but only to nearby organs and not to distant regions of the body. At specialized medical centers, this combination may be used before surgery to help shrink the tumor. Sometimes it is used after surgery to reduce the risk that pancreatic cancer may recur. In people with advanced pancreatic cancer, chemotherapy is often used to control cancer growth and prolong survival. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams, such as those made from X-rays and protons, to destroy cancer cells. You may receive radiation treatments before or after cancer surgery, often in combination with chemotherapy. Or your doctor may recommend a combination of radiation and chemotherapy treatments when your cancer can't be treated surgically. Radiation therapy usually comes from a machine that moves around you, directing radiation to specific points on your body (external beam radiation). In specialized medical centers, radiation therapy may be delivered during surgery (intraoperative radiation). Radiation therapy traditionally uses X-rays to treat cancer. Some medical centers offer proton beam radiation therapy, which may be a treatment option for some people with advanced pancreatic cancer. Clinical trials Clinical trials are studies to test new treatments, such as systemic therapy, and new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy. If the treatment being studied proves to be safer and more effective than are current treatments, it can become the new standard of care. Clinical trials for pancreatic cancer might give you a chance to try new targeted therapy, chemotherapy drugs, immunotherapy treatments or vaccines. Clinical trials can't guarantee a cure, and they might have serious or unexpected side effects. On the other hand, cancer clinical trials are closely monitored to ensure they're conducted as safely as possible. And they offer access to treatments that wouldn't otherwise be available to you. Talk to your doctor about what clinical trials might be appropriate for you. Supportive (palliative) care Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. Palliative care can be used while undergoing aggressive treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. When palliative care is used along with other appropriate treatments - even soon after the diagnosis - people with cancer may feel better and live longer. Palliative care is provided by teams of doctors, nurses and other specially trained professionals. These teams aim to improve the quality of life for people with cancer and their families. Palliative care is not the same as hospice care or end-of-life care. Some integrative and alternative medicine approaches may help with signs and symptoms you experience due to your cancer or cancer treatments. Treatments to help you cope with distress People with cancer frequently experience distress. Some research suggests distress is more common in people with pancreatic cancer than it is in people with other types of cancer. If you're distressed, you may have difficulty sleeping and find yourself constantly thinking about your cancer. You may feel angry or sad. Discuss your feelings with your doctor. Specialists can help you sort through your feelings and help you devise strategies for coping. In some cases, medications may help. Integrative medicine and alternative therapies may also help you cope with distress. Examples include: - Art therapy - Exercise - Meditation - Music therapy - Relaxation exercises - Spirituality Talk with your doctor if you're interested in these treatment options."

The two types of pancreatic islet transplantation are allo-transplantation auto-transplantation Pancreatic islet allo-transplantation is a procedure in which islets from the pancreas of a deceased organ donor are purified, processed, and transferred into another person. Pancreatic islet allo-transplantation is currently labeled an experimental procedure until the transplantation technology is considered successful enough to be labeled therapeutic. For more information, see the section \"What are the obstacles to pancreatic islet allo-transplantation?\" For each pancreatic islet allo-transplant infusion, researchers use specialized enzymes to remove islets from the pancreas of a single, deceased donor. The islets are purified and counted in a lab. Transplant patients typically receive two infusions with an average of 400,000 to 500,000 islets per infusion. Once implanted, the beta cells in these islets begin to make and release insulin. Pancreatic islet allo-transplantation is performed in certain patients with type 1 diabetes whose blood glucose levels are difficult to control. The goals of the transplant are to help these patients achieve normal blood glucose levels with or without daily injections of insulin and to reduce or eliminate hypoglycemia unawareness\u2014a dangerous condition in which a person with diabetes cannot feel the symptoms of hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose. When a person feels the symptoms of hypoglycemia, steps can be taken to bring blood glucose levels back to normal. Pancreatic islet allo-transplants are only performed at hospitals that have received permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical research on islet transplantation. The transplants are often performed by a radiologist\u2014a doctor who specializes in medical imaging. The radiologist uses x rays and ultrasound to guide the placement of a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through a small incision in the upper abdomen\u2014the area between the chest and hips\u2014and into the portal vein of the liver. The portal vein is the major vein that supplies blood to the liver. The islets are then infused, or pushed, slowly into the liver through the catheter. Usually, the patient receives a local anesthetic and a sedative. In some cases, a surgeon performs the transplant using general anesthesia. Patients often need two or more transplants to get enough functioning islets to stop or reduce their need for insulin injections. Pancreatic islet allo-transplantation (above). In islet auto-transplantation, the islets are extracted from the patient's own pancreas. Pancreatic islet auto-transplantation is performed following total pancreatectomy\u2014the surgical removal of the whole pancreas\u2014in patients with severe and chronic, or long lasting, pancreatitis that cannot be managed by other treatments. This procedure is not considered experimental. Patients with type 1 diabetes cannot receive pancreatic islet auto-transplantation. The procedure is performed in a hospital, and the patient receives general anesthesia. The surgeon first removes the pancreas and then extracts and purifies islets from the pancreas. Within hours, the islets are infused through a catheter into the patient's liver. The goal is to give the body enough healthy islets to make insulin. What happens after pancreatic islet transplantation? Pancreatic islets begin to release insulin soon after transplantation. However, full islet function and new blood vessel growth from the new islets take time. Transplant recipients usually take insulin injections until the islets are fully functional. They may also receive various medications before and after transplantation to promote successful implantation and long-term functioning of the islets. However, the autoimmune response that destroyed transplant recipients' own islets in the first place can happen again and attack the transplanted islets. Although the liver has been the traditional site for infusing the donor islets, researchers are investigating alternative sites, such as muscle tissue or another organ. What are the benefits and risks of pancreatic islet allo-transplantation? The benefits of pancreatic islet allo-transplantation include improved blood glucose control, reducing or eliminating the need for insulin injections to control diabetes, and preventing hypoglycemia. An alternative to islet transplantation is whole organ pancreas transplantation that is performed most often with kidney transplantation. The advantages of whole organ pancreas transplantation are less dependence on insulin and longer duration of organ function. The main disadvantage is that a whole organ transplant is a major surgery that involves a greater risk of complications and even death. Pancreatic islet allo-transplantation can also help reverse hypoglycemia unawareness. Research has shown that even partial islet function after a transplant can eliminate hypoglycemia unawareness. Improved blood glucose control from a successful allo-transplant may also slow or prevent the progression of diabetes problems, such as heart disease, kidney disease, and nerve or eye damage. Research to evaluate this possibility is ongoing. The risks of pancreatic islet allo-transplantation include the risks associated with the transplant procedure\u2014particularly bleeding and blood clots. The transplanted islets may not function well or may stop functioning entirely. Other risks are the side effects from the immunosuppressive medications that transplant recipients must take to stop the immune system from rejecting the transplanted islets. When a patient has received a kidney transplant and is already taking immunosuppressive medications, the only additional risks are the islet infusion and the side effects from the immunosuppressive medications given at the time of allo-transplantation. Immunosuppressive medications are not needed in the case of an auto-transplant because the infused cells come from the patient's own body. Read more in the section \"What is the role of immunosuppressive medications?\" Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry Data In its 2010 annual report,1 the Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry presented data on 571 patients who received pancreatic islet allo-transplants between 1999 and 2009. Although most procedures were pancreatic islet allo-transplants alone, 90 procedures were done in conjunction with a kidney transplant. The majority of the islet transplant patients received one or two infusions of islets; at the end of the decade, the average number of islets received per infusion was 463,000. According to the report, about 60 percent of transplant recipients achieved insulin independence\u2014defined as being able to stop insulin injections for at least 14 days\u2014during the year following transplantation. By the end of the second year, 50 percent of recipients were able to stop taking insulin for at least 14 days. However, long-term insulin independence is difficult to maintain, and eventually most recipients needed to start taking insulin again. The report identified factors linked to better outcomes for recipients, including age\u201435 years or older lower pre-transplant triglyceride, or blood fat, levels lower pre-transplant insulin use The report noted that even partial function of the transplanted islets can improve blood glucose control and reduce the amount of insulin needed after loss of insulin independence. 1Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry seventh annual report.

What is the role of immunosuppressive medications? Immunosuppressive medications are needed to prevent rejection\u2014a common problem with any transplant. Scientists have made many advances in islet transplantation in recent years. In 2000, islet transplantation researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, reported their findings in the New England Journal of Medicine. Their transplant protocol, known as the Edmonton protocol, has since been adapted by transplant centers around the world and continues to be refined. The Edmonton protocol introduced the use of a new combination of immunosuppressive medications, also called anti-rejection medications, including daclizumab (Zenapax), sirolimus (Rapamune), and tacrolimus (Prograf). Researchers continue to develop and study modifications to the Edmonton protocol, including improved medication regimens that promote successful transplants. Medication regimens vary from one transplant center to another. Examples of other immunosuppressive medications used in islet transplantation include antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin), alemtuzumab (Campath), basiliximab (Simulect), belatacept (Nulojix), etanercept (Enbrel), everolimus (Zortress), and mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept, Myfortic). Researchers are also evaluating nonimmunosuppresive medications, such as exenatide (Byetta) and sitagliptin (Januvia). Immunosuppressive medications have significant side effects, and their long-term effects are still not fully known. Immediate side effects may include mouth sores and gastrointestinal problems, such as upset stomach and diarrhea. Patients may also have increased blood cholesterol, or blood fat, levels high blood pressure anemia, a condition in which red blood cells are fewer or smaller than normal, which prevents the body's cells from getting enough oxygen fatigue decreased white blood cell counts decreased kidney function increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections Taking immunosuppressive medications also increases the risk of developing certain tumors and cancers. Scientists are seeking ways to achieve immune tolerance of the transplanted islets, in which the patient's immune system no longer recognizes the islets as foreign. Immune tolerance would allow patients to maintain transplanted islets without long-term use of immunosuppressive medications. For example, one approach is to transplant islets encapsulated with a special coating, which may help to prevent rejection. What are the obstacles to pancreatic islet allo-transplantation? The shortage of islets from donors is a significant obstacle to widespread use of pancreatic islet allo-transplantation. According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, in 2011 there were about 8,000 deceased organ donors available in the United States.2 However, only 1,562 pancreases were recovered from donors in 2011.2 Also, many donated pancreases are not suitable for extracting islets for transplants because they do not meet the selection criteria, and islets are often damaged or destroyed during processing. Therefore, only a small number of islet transplants can be performed each year. Researchers are pursuing various approaches to solve this shortage of islets, such as transplanting islets from a single, donated pancreas, using only a portion of the pancreas from a living donor, or using islets from pigs. Researchers have transplanted pig islets into other animals, including monkeys, by encapsulating the islets with a special coating or by using medications to prevent rejection. Another approach is creating islets from other types of cells, such as stem cells. New technologies could then be employed to grow islets in the lab. Financial barriers also prevent the widespread use of islet allo-transplantation. Until the transplantation technology is considered successful enough to be labeled therapeutic rather than experimental, the costs of islet allo-transplants must be covered by research funds. Health insurance companies and Medicare generally do not cover experimental procedures. Federal law also does not allow health care providers or hospitals to charge patients or health insurance companies for research procedures. Some patient advocates and islet researchers feel that islet allo-transplantation is close to having a therapeutic label. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) currently supports studies that are working toward obtaining FDA licensure to reclassify islet allo-transplantation as therapeutic. In other countries, such as Canada and Scandinavia, islet allo-transplantation is no longer considered experimental and is an accepted therapy in certain patients. 2National data. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network website. https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/. Accessed July 23, 2013. Eating, Diet, and Nutrition A person who receives a pancreatic islet transplant should follow a meal plan worked out with a health care provider and dietitian. Immunosuppressive medications taken after the transplant can cause changes in a person's body, such as weight gain. A healthy diet after the transplant is important to control weight gain, blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood glucose levels. Points to Remember Pancreatic islets, also called islets of Langerhans, are tiny clusters of cells scattered throughout the pancreas. Pancreatic islets contain several types of cells, including beta cells, that produce the hormone insulin. Insulin helps cells throughout the body absorb glucose from the bloodstream and use it for energy. Pancreatic islet allo-transplantation is a procedure in which islets from the pancreas of a deceased organ donor are purified, processed, and transferred into another person. Pancreatic islet allo-transplantation is performed in certain patients with type 1 diabetes whose blood glucose levels are difficult to control. The goals of the transplant are to help these patients achieve normal blood glucose levels with or without daily injections of insulin and to reduce or eliminate hypoglycemia unawareness. Pancreatic islet auto-transplantation is performed following total pancreatectomy in patients with severe and chronic pancreatitis that cannot be managed by other treatments. This procedure is not considered experimental. Patients with type 1 diabetes cannot receive pancreatic islet auto-transplantation. The shortage of islets from donors is a significant obstacle to widespread use of pancreatic islet allo-transplantation. Financial barriers also prevent the widespread use of islet allo-transplantation. Until the transplantation technology is considered successful enough to be labeled therapeutic rather than experimental, the costs of islet allo-transplants must be covered by research funds. Clinical Trials The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions.

        "query": "what are some common symptoms of bulimia",
        "document": "Bulimia: Bulimia is an eating disorder in which a person has regular episodes of eating a very large amount of food (bingeing) during which the person feels a loss of control over eating. The person then uses different ways, such as vomiting or laxatives (purging), to prevent weight gain.   Many people with bulimia also have anorexia nervosa. Many more women than men have bulimia. The disorder is most common in teenage girls and young women. The person usually knows that her eating pattern is abnormal. She may feel fear or guilt with the binge-purge episodes.   The exact cause of bulimia is unknown. Genetic, psychological, family, society, or cultural factors may play a role. Bulimia is likely due to more than one factor. With bulimia, eating binges may occur as often as several times a day for many months. The person often eats large amounts of high-calorie foods, usually in secret. During these episodes, the person feels a lack of control over the eating.   Binges lead to self-disgust, which causes purging to prevent weight gain. Purging may include:     - Forcing oneself to vomit   - Excessive exercise   - Using laxatives, enemas, or diuretics (water pills)      Purging often brings a sense of relief.   People with bulimia are often at a normal weight, but they may see themselves as being overweight. Because the person's weight is often normal, other people may not notice this eating disorder.   Symptoms that other people can see include:     - Spending a lot of time exercising   - Suddenly eating large amounts of food or buying large amounts of food that disappear right away   - Regularly going to the bathroom right after meals   - Throwing away packages of laxatives, diet pills, emetics (drugs that cause vomiting), or diuretics A dental exam may show cavities or gum infections (such as gingivitis). The enamel of the teeth may be worn away or pitted because of too much exposure to the acid in vomit.   A physical exam may also show:     - Broken blood vessels in the eyes (from the strain of vomiting)   - Dry mouth   - Pouch-like look to the cheeks    - Rashes and pimples   - Small cuts and calluses across the tops of the finger joints from forcing oneself to vomit     Blood tests may show an electrolyte imbalance (such as low potassium level) or dehydration. People with bulimia rarely have to go to the hospital, unless they:     - Have anorexia   - Have major depression   - Need medicines to help them stop purging      Most often, a stepped approach is used to treat bulimia. Treatment depends on how severe the bulimia is, and the person's response to treatments:     - Support groups may be helpful for mild bulimia without other health problems.   - Counseling, such as talk therapy and nutritional therapy are the first treatments for bulimia that does not respond to support groups.   - Medicines that also treat depression, known as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used for bulimia. Combining talk therapy with SSRIs may help, if talk therapy alone does not work.      People may drop out of programs if they have unrealistic hopes of being \"cured\" by therapy alone. Before a program begins, people should know that:     - Different therapies will likely be needed to manage this disorder.   - It is common for bulimia to return (relapse), and this is no cause for despair.   - The process is painful, and the person and their family will need to work hard. The stress of illness can be eased by joining a support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Bulimia is a long-term illness. Many people will still have some symptoms, even with treatment.   People with fewer medical complications of bulimia and those willing and able to take part in therapy have a better chance of recovery. Bulimia can be dangerous. It may lead to serious health problems over time. For example, vomiting over and over can cause:     - Stomach acid in the esophagus (the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach). This can lead to permanent damage of this area.   - Tears in the esophagus   - Dental cavities   - Swelling of the throat      Vomiting and overuse of enemas or laxatives can lead to:     - Your body not having as much water and fluid as it should   - Low level of potassium in the blood, which may lead to dangerous heart rhythm problems   - Hard stools or constipation   - Hemorrhoids   - Damage of the pancreas Call for an appointment with your health care provider if you or your child has symptoms of an eating disorder.

        "query": "what are some common symptoms of bulimia",
        "document": "Bulimia nervosa: Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa, commonly called bulimia, is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder. People with bulimia may secretly binge - eating large amounts of food - and then purge, trying to get rid of the extra calories in an unhealthy way. For example, someone with bulimia may force vomiting or engage in excessive exercise. Sometimes people purge after eating only a small snack or a normal-size meal. Bulimia can be categorized in two ways: - Purging bulimia. You regularly self-induce vomiting or misuse laxatives, diuretics or enemas after bingeing.   - Nonpurging bulimia. You use other methods to rid yourself of calories and prevent weight gain, such as fasting, strict dieting or excessive exercise. However, these behaviors often overlap, and the attempt to rid yourself of extra calories is usually referred to as purging, no matter what the method. If you have bulimia, you're probably preoccupied with your weight and body shape. You may judge yourself severely and harshly for self-perceived flaws. Because it's related to self-image - and not just about food - bulimia can be hard to overcome. But effective treatment can help you feel better about yourself, adopt healthier eating patterns and reverse serious complications. Bulimia care at Mayo Clinic Bulimia signs and symptoms may include: - Being preoccupied with your body shape and weight    - Living in fear of gaining weight   - Feeling that you can't control your eating behavior   - Eating until the point of discomfort or pain   - Eating much more food in a binge episode than in a normal meal or snack   - Forcing yourself to vomit or exercise too much to keep from gaining weight after bingeing   - Misusing laxatives, diuretics or enemas after eating   - Restricting calories or avoiding certain foods between binges   - Using dietary supplements or herbal products excessively for weight loss If you have any bulimia symptoms, seek medical help as soon as possible.

There are many factors that could play a role in the development of eating disorders, including biology, emotional health, societal expectations and other issues. Factors that increase your risk of bulimia may include: - Being female. Girls and women are more likely to have bulimia than boys and men are.   - Age. Bulimia often begins in the late teens or early adulthood.   - Biology. People with first-degree relatives (siblings, parents or children) with an eating disorder may be more likely to develop an eating disorder, suggesting a possible genetic link. It's also possible that a deficiency in the brain chemical serotonin may play a role. And, being overweight as a child or teen may increase the risk.   - Psychological and emotional issues. Psychological and emotional problems, such as anxiety disorder or low self-esteem, can contribute to eating disorders. Triggers for bingeing may include stress, poor body self-image, food, restrictive dieting or boredom. In some cases, traumatic events and environmental stress may be contributing factors.   - Media and societal pressure. The media, such as TV and fashion magazines, frequently feature a parade of skinny models and actors. These images seem to equate thinness with success and popularity. But whether the media merely reflect social values or actually drive them isn't clear.   - Sports, work or artistic pressures. Athletes, actors, dancers and models are at a higher risk of eating disorders. Coaches and parents may inadvertently raise the risk by encouraging young athletes to lose weight, maintain a low weight and restrict eating for better performance. Bulimia may cause numerous serious and even life-threatening complications. Possible complications include: - Dehydration, which can lead to major medical problems, such as kidney failure   - Heart problems, such as an irregular heartbeat or heart failure   - Severe tooth decay and gum disease   - Absent or irregular periods in females   - Digestive problems, and possibly a dependence on laxatives to have bowel movements   - Anxiety and depression   - Misuse of alcohol or drugs   - Suicide If your doctor suspects you have bulimia, he or she will typically perform: - A complete physical exam - Blood and urine tests - A psychological evaluation, including a discussion of your eating habits and attitude toward food Your doctor may also request additional tests to help pinpoint a diagnosis, rule out medical causes for weight changes and check for any related complications. Criteria for diagnosis For a diagnosis of bulimia, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, lists these points: - You recurrently have episodes of eating an abnormally large amount of food -- more than most people would eat in a similar amount of time and under similar circumstances, for example, in a two-hour time period - You feel a lack of control during bingeing, such as how much you're eating and whether you can stop eating - You get rid of the extra calories from bingeing to avoid weight gain by vomiting, excessive exercise, fasting, or misuse of laxatives, diuretics or other medications - You binge and purge at least once a week for at least three months - Your body shape and weight influence your feelings of self-worth too much - You don't have anorexia, an eating disorder with extremely restrictive eating behaviors The severity of bulimia is determined by the number of times a week that you purge. Even if you don't meet all of these criteria, you could still have an eating disorder. Don't try to diagnose yourself - get professional help if you have any eating disorder symptoms. When you have bulimia, you may need several types of treatment, although combining psychotherapy with antidepressants may be the most effective for overcoming the disorder. Treatment generally involves a team approach that includes you, your family, your primary care doctor or other health care provider, as well as a mental health provider and a dietitian experienced in treating eating disorders. You may have a case manager to coordinate your care. Here's a look at bulimia treatment options and considerations. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, involves discussing your bulimia and related issues with a mental health provider. Evidence indicates that these types of psychotherapy help improve symptoms of bulimia: - Cognitive behavioral therapy to help you identify unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and replace them with healthy, positive ones - Family-based therapy to help parents intervene to stop their teenager's unhealthy eating behaviors, then to help the teen regain control over his or her own eating, and lastly to help the family deal with problems that bulimia can have on the teen's development and the family - Interpersonal psychotherapy, which addresses difficulties in your close relationships, helping to improve your communication and problem-solving skills Ask your mental health provider which psychotherapy he or she will use and what evidence exists that shows it's beneficial in treating bulimia. Medications Antidepressants may help reduce the symptoms of bulimia when used along with psychotherapy. The only antidepressant specifically approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat bulimia is fluoxetine (Prozac), a type of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which may help even if you're not depressed. Nutrition education and healthy weight Dietitians and other health care providers can design an eating plan to help you achieve a healthy weight, normal eating habits and good nutrition. If you have bulimia, you may benefit from a medically supervised weight-loss program. Hospitalization Bulimia can usually be treated outside of the hospital. But if you have a severe form and serious health complications, you may need treatment in a hospital. Some eating disorder programs may offer day treatment rather than inpatient hospitalization. Treatment challenges in bulimia Although most people with bulimia do recover, some find that symptoms don't go away entirely. Periods of bingeing and purging may come and go through the years, depending on your life circumstances, such as recurrence during times of high stress. If you find yourself back in the binge-purge cycle, \"booster\" sessions with your health care providers may help you weather the crisis before your eating disorder spirals out of control again. Learning positive ways to cope, creating healthy relationships and managing stress can help prevent a relapse. Although you can't treat bulimia on your own, in addition to professional treatment, follow these self-care tips for bulimia: - Stick to your treatment plan. Don't skip therapy sessions and try not to stray from meal plans, even if they make you uncomfortable. - Learn about bulimia. Education about your condition can empower you and motivate you to stick to your treatment plan. - Get the right nutrition. If you aren't eating well or you're frequently purging, it's likely your body isn't getting all of the nutrients it needs. Eating regularly and not restricting your food intake is the first step in overcoming bulimia. Talk to your doctor about appropriate vitamin and mineral supplements. - Stay in touch. Don't isolate yourself from caring family members and friends who want to see you get healthy. Understand that they have your best interests at heart and that nurturing, caring relationships are healthy for you. - Be kind to yourself. Resist urges to weigh yourself or check yourself in the mirror frequently. These may do nothing but fuel your drive to maintain unhealthy habits. - Be cautious with exercise. Talk to your health care provider about what kind of physical activity, if any, is appropriate for you, especially if you exercise excessively to burn off post-binge calories. Dietary supplements and herbal products designed to suppress the appetite or aid in weight loss may be abused by people with eating disorders. Weight-loss supplements or herbs can have serious side effects and dangerously interact with other medications. If you use dietary supplements or herbs, discuss the potential risks with your doctor."

        "document": "Klinefelter syndrome (Treatment): If you or your son is diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome, your health care team may include a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders involving the body's glands and hormones (endocrinologist), a speech therapist, a pediatrician, a physical therapist, a genetic counselor, a reproductive medicine or infertility specialist, and a counselor or psychologist. Although there's no way to repair the sex chromosome changes due to Klinefelter syndrome, treatments can help minimize its effects. The earlier a diagnosis is made and treatment is started, the greater the benefits. But it's never too late to get help. Treatment for Klinefelter syndrome may include: - Testosterone replacement therapy. Starting at the time of the usual onset of puberty, testosterone replacement can be given to help stimulate changes that normally occur at puberty, such as developing a deeper voice, growing facial and body hair, and increasing muscle mass and penis size. Testosterone therapy can also improve bone density and reduce the risk of fractures. It will not result in testicle enlargement or improve infertility. - Breast tissue removal. In males who develop enlarged breasts, excess breast tissue can be removed by a plastic surgeon, leaving a more normal-looking chest. - Speech and physical therapy. These treatments can help boys with Klinefelter syndrome overcome problems with speech, language and muscle weakness. - Educational evaluation and support. Some boys with Klinefelter syndrome have trouble learning and socializing and can benefit from extra assistance. Talk to your child's teacher, school counselor or school nurse about what kind of support might help. - Fertility treatment. Most men with Klinefelter syndrome are unable to father children because few or no sperm are produced in the testicles. For some men with minimal sperm production, a procedure called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) may help. During ICSI, sperm is removed from the testicle with a biopsy needle and injected directly into the egg. - Psychological counseling.

If you're overweight and thinking of becoming pregnant, losing weight and eating well might affect your child's future. Eating well throughout pregnancy might also have a positive impact on your baby's later food choices. To give your infant a healthy start, the World Health Organization recommends exclusively breast-feeding for 6 months. If your child is overweight or obese, his or her best chance to achieve and maintain a healthy weight is to start eating a healthy diet and exercising more. Here are some steps you can take at home to help your child succeed: - Be a role model. Choose healthy foods and active pastimes for yourself. If you need to lose weight, doing so will motivate your child to do likewise. - Involve the whole family. Make healthy eating a priority and emphasize how important it is for everyone to be physically active. This avoids singling out the child who is overweight."

        "document": "Childhood obesity (Risk factors): Many factors - usually working in combination - increase your child's risk of becoming overweight: - Diet. Regularly eating high-calorie foods, such as fast foods, baked goods and vending machine snacks, can easily cause your child to gain weight. Candy and desserts also can cause weight gain, and more and more evidence points to sugary drinks, including fruit juices, as culprits in obesity in some people.   - Lack of exercise. Children who don't exercise much are more likely to gain weight because they don't burn as many calories. Too much time spent in sedentary activities, such as watching television or playing video games, also contributes to the problem.   - Family factors. If your child comes from a family of overweight people, he or she may be more likely to put on weight. This is especially true in an environment where high-calorie foods are always available and physical activity isn't encouraged.   - Psychological factors. Personal, parental and family stress can increase a child's risk of obesity. Some children overeat to cope with problems or to deal with emotions, such as stress, or to fight boredom. Their parents may have similar tendencies.   - Socioeconomic factors. People in some communities have limited resources and limited access to supermarkets. As a result, they may opt for convenience foods that don't spoil quickly, such as frozen meals, crackers and cookies. In addition, people who live in lower income neighborhoods might not have access to a safe place to exercise."

Some risk factors can be changed, such as unhealthy lifestyle habits and environments. Other risk factors, such as age, family history and genetics, race and ethnicity, and sex, cannot be changed. Heathy lifestyle changes\u00a0can decrease your risk for developing overweight and obesity. Unhealthy lifestyle habits Lack of physical activity, unhealthy eating patterns, not enough sleep, and high amounts of stress can increase your risk for overweight and obesity. Lack of physical activity Lack of physical activity due to high amounts of TV, computer, videogame or other screen usage has been associated with a high body mass index. Healthy lifestyle changes, such as being physically active and reducing screen time, can help you aim for a healthy weight. Unhealthy eating behaviors Some unhealthy eating behaviors can increase your risk for overweight and obesity. Eating more calories than you use. The amount of calories you need will vary based on your sex, age, and physical activity level. Find out your daily calorie needs or goals with the Body Weight Planner. Eating too much saturated and trans fats Eating foods high in added sugars Visit Heart-healthy eating for more information about healthy eating patterns. Not enough sleep Many studies have seen a high BMI in people who do not get enough sleep. Some studies have seen a relationship between sleep and the way our bodies use nutrients for energy and how lack of sleep can affect hormones that control hunger urges. Visit our Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency Health Topic for more information about lack of sleep. High amounts of stress Acute stress and chronic stress affect the brain and trigger the production of hormones, such as cortisol, that control our energy balances and hunger urges. Acute stress can trigger hormone changes that make you not want to eat. If the stress becomes chronic, hormone changes can make you eat more and store more fat. Age Childhood obesity remains a serious problem in the United States, and some populations are more at risk for childhood obesity than others. The risk of unhealthy weight gain increases as you age. Adults who have a healthy BMI often start to gain weight in young adulthood and continue to gain weight until 60 to 65 years old, when they tend to start losing weight. Unhealthy environments Many environmental factors can increase your risk for overweight and obesity: \u00a0 social factors such as having a low socioeconomic status or an unhealthy social or unsafe environment in the neighborhood\u00a0 built environment factors such as easy access to unhealthy fast foods, limited access to recreational facilities or parks, and few safe or easy ways to walk in your neighborhood exposure to chemicals known as obesogens that can change hormones and increase fatty tissue in our bodies Family history and genetics Genetic studies have found that overweight and obesity can run in families, so it is possible that our genes or DNA can cause these conditions. Research studies have found that certain DNA elements are associated with obesity. Read more Did you know obesity can change your DNA and the DNA you pass on to your children? Learn more about these DNA changes. Eating too much or eating too little during your pregnancy can change your baby\u2019s DNA and can affect how your child stores and uses fat later in life. Also, studies have shown that obese fathers have DNA changes in their sperm that can be passed on to their children. Race or ethnicity Overweight and obesity is highly prevalent in some racial and ethnic minority groups. Rates of obesity in American adults are highest in blacks, followed by Hispanics, then whites. This is true for men or women. While Asian men and women have the lowest rates of unhealthy BMIs, they may have high amounts of unhealthy fat in the abdomen. Samoans may be at risk for overweight and obesity because they may carry a DNA variant that is associated with increased BMI but not with common obesity-related complications. Sex In the United States, obesity is more common in black or Hispanic women than in black or Hispanic men. A person\u2019s sex may also affect the way the body stores fat. For example, women tend to store less unhealthy fat in the abdomen\u00a0than men do. Overweight and obesity is also common in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

        "document": "What causes Obesity?: Taking in more calories than your body burns can lead to obesity. This is because the body stores unused calories as fat. Obesity can be caused by:  - Eating more food than your body can use  - Drinking too much alcohol  - Not getting enough exercise    Many obese people who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost.  Today, we know that biology is a big reason why some people cannot keep the weight off. Some people who live in the same place and eat the same foods become obese, while others do not. Our bodies have a complex system to keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system does not work normally.   The way we eat when we are children can affect the way we eat as adults.   The way we eat over many years becomes a habit. It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat.   We may feel that we are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to stay active.   - Many people feel they do not have time to plan and make healthy meals.  - More people today work desk jobs compared to more active jobs in the past.  - People with little free time may have less time to exercise.    The term eating disorder means a group of medical conditions that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image. A person may be obese, follow an unhealthy diet, and have an eating disorder all at the same time.  Sometimes, medical problems or treatments cause weight gain, including:  - Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)  - Medicines such as birth control pills, antidepressants, and antipsychotics    Other things that can cause weight gain are:  - Quitting smoking. Many people who quit smoking gain 4 to 10 pounds in the first 6 months after quitting.  - Stress, anxiety, feeling sad, or not sleeping well  - Menopause. Women may gain 12 to 15 pounds during menopause.  - Pregnancy. Women may not lose the weight they gained during pregnancy."

        "document": "Pulmonary Hypertension (Causes): Pulmonary hypertension (PH) begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH. Many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of PH. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may have no known cause, or the condition may be inherited. (\"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) Some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 PAH. Examples include HIV infection, congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease. Also, the use of street drugs (such as cocaine) and certain diet medicines can lead to PAH.

        "query": "what are the causes of pulmonary hypertension",
        "document": "Pulmonary hypertension: Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in your lungs and the right side of your heart. In one form of pulmonary hypertension, tiny arteries in your lungs, called pulmonary arterioles, and capillaries become narrowed, blocked or destroyed. This makes it harder for blood to flow through your lungs, and raises pressure within your lungs' arteries. As the pressure builds, your heart's lower right chamber (right ventricle) must work harder to pump blood through your lungs, eventually causing your heart muscle to weaken and fail. Some forms of pulmonary hypertension are serious conditions that become progressively worse and are sometimes fatal. Although some forms of pulmonary hypertension aren't curable, treatment can help lessen symptoms and improve your quality of life. The signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension in its early stages might not be noticeable for months or even years. As the disease progresses, symptoms become worse. Pulmonary hypertension symptoms include: - Shortness of breath (dyspnea), initially while exercising and eventually while at rest   - Fatigue   - Dizziness or fainting spells (syncope)   - Chest pressure or pain   - Swelling (edema) in your ankles, legs and eventually in your abdomen (ascites)   - Bluish color to your lips and skin (cyanosis)   - Racing pulse or heart palpitations Your heart has two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery). In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart. Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs. With pulmonary hypertension, the rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, and extra tissue may form. The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight. These changes in the pulmonary arteries can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels. This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, depending on the cause. Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension - Cause unknown, known as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension   - A specific gene mutation that can cause pulmonary hypertension to develop in families, also called heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension   - Certain drugs - such as certain prescription diet drugs or illegal drugs such as methamphetamines - or certain toxins   - Heart abnormalities present at birth (congenital heart disease)   - Other conditions, such as connective tissue disorders (scleroderma, lupus, others), HIV infection or chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension caused by left-sided heart disease - Left-sided valvular heart disease, such as mitral valve or aortic valve disease   - Failure of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension caused by lung disease - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as emphysema   - Lung disease such as pulmonary fibrosis, a condition that causes scarring in the tissue between the lungs' air sacs (interstitium)   - Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders   - Long-term exposure to high altitudes in people who may be at higher risk of pulmonary hypertension Group 4: Pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic blood clots - Chronic blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary emboli) Group 5: Pulmonary hypertension associated with other conditions that have unclear reasons why the pulmonary hypertension occurs - Blood disorders   - Disorders that affect several organs in the body, such as sarcoidosis   - Metabolic disorders, such as glycogen storage disease   - Tumors pressing against pulmonary arteries Eisenmenger syndrome and pulmonary hypertension Eisenmenger syndrome, a type of congenital heart disease, causes pulmonary hypertension. It's most commonly caused by a large hole in your heart between the two lower heart chambers (ventricles), called a ventricular septal defect. This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart. Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood). The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension. Your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension may be greater if: - You're a young adult, as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is more common in younger adults   - You're overweight   - You have a family history of the disease   - You have one of various conditions that can increase your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension   - You use illegal drugs, such as cocaine   - You take certain appetite-suppressant medications   - You have an existing risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, such as a family history of the condition, and you live at a high altitude Pulmonary hypertension is hard to diagnose early because it's not often detected in a routine physical exam. Even when the condition is more advanced, its signs and symptoms are similar to those of other heart and lung conditions. To diagnose your condition, your doctor may review your medical and family history, discuss your signs and symptoms, and conduct a physical examination. Doctors may order several tests to diagnose pulmonary hypertension, determine the severity of your condition and find out the cause of your condition. Tests may include: - Echocardiogram. Sound waves can create moving images of the beating heart. An echocardiogram can help your doctor to check the size and functioning of the right ventricle, and the thickness of the right ventricle's wall. An echocardiogram can also show how well your heart chambers and valves are working. Doctors may also use this to measure the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. In some cases, your doctor will recommend an exercise echocardiogram to help determine how well your heart and lungs work under stress. In this test, you'll have an echocardiogram before exercising on a stationary bike or treadmill and another test immediately afterward. This could be done as an oxygen consumption test, in which you may have to wear a mask that assesses the ability of your heart and lungs to deal with oxygen and carbon dioxide. Other exercise tests may also be done. These tests can help determine the severity and cause of your condition. They may also be done at follow-up appointments to check that your treatments are working. - Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show images of your heart, lungs and chest. This test can show enlargement of the right ventricle of the heart or the pulmonary arteries, which can occur in pulmonary hypertension. This test can also be used to identify other conditions that may be causing pulmonary hypertension. - Electrocardiogram (ECG). This noninvasive test shows your heart's electrical patterns and can detect abnormal rhythms. Doctors may also be able to see signs of right ventricle enlargement or strain. - Right heart catheterization. After you've had an echocardiogram, if your doctor thinks you have pulmonary hypertension, you'll likely have a right heart catheterization. This test can often help confirm that you have pulmonary hypertension and determine the severity of your condition. During the procedure, a cardiologist places a thin, flexible tube (catheter) into a vein in your neck or groin. The catheter is then threaded into your right ventricle and pulmonary artery. Right heart catheterization allows your doctor to directly measure the pressure in the main pulmonary arteries and right ventricle. It's also used to see what effect different medications may have on your pulmonary hypertension. - Blood tests. Your doctor might order blood tests to check for certain substances in your blood that might show you have pulmonary hypertension or its complications. Blood tests can also test for certain conditions that may be causing your condition. Your doctor might order additional tests to check the condition of your lungs and pulmonary arteries and to determine the cause of your condition, including: - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. During a CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. CT scanning generates X-rays to produce cross-sectional images of your body. Doctors may inject a dye into your blood vessels that helps your arteries to be more visible on the CT pictures (CT angiography). Doctors may use this test to look at the heart's size and function and to check for blood clots in the lungs' arteries. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test may be used to check the right ventricle's function and the blood flow in the lung's arteries. In this test, you lie on a movable table that slides into the tunnel. An MRI uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio wave energy to make pictures of the body. - Pulmonary function test. This noninvasive test measures how much air your lungs can hold, and the airflow in and out of your lungs. During the test, you'll blow into a simple instrument called a spirometer. - Polysomnogram. This test detects your brain activity, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and other factors while you sleep. It can help diagnose a sleep disorder such as obstructive sleep apnea. - Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan. In this test, a tracer is injected into a vein in your arm. The tracer maps blood flow and air to your lungs. This test can be used to determine whether blood clots are causing symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. - Open-lung biopsy. Rarely, a doctor might recommend an open-lung biopsy. An open-lung biopsy is a type of surgery in which a small sample of tissue is removed from your lungs under general anesthesia to check for a possible secondary cause of pulmonary hypertension. Genetic tests If a family member has had pulmonary hypertension, your doctor might screen you for genes that are linked with pulmonary hypertension. If you test positive, your doctor might recommend that other family members be screened for the same genetic mutation. Pulmonary hypertension classifications Once you've been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, your doctor might classify the severity of your disease into one of several classes, including: - Class I. Although you've been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, you have no symptoms with normal activity. - Class II. You don't have symptoms at rest, but you experience symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath or chest pain with normal activity. - Class III. You're comfortable at rest, but have symptoms when you're physically active. - Class IV. You have symptoms with physical activity and while at rest. Pulmonary hypertension can't be cured, but doctors can help you manage your condition. Treatment may help improve your symptoms and slow the progress of pulmonary hypertension. It often takes some time to find the most appropriate treatment for pulmonary hypertension. The treatments are often complex and require extensive follow-up care. Your doctor might also need to change your treatment if it's no longer effective. When pulmonary hypertension is caused by another condition, your doctor will treat the underlying cause whenever possible. Medications - Blood vessel dilators (vasodilators). Vasodilators open narrowed blood vessels. One of the most commonly prescribed vasodilators for pulmonary hypertension is epoprostenol (Flolan, Veletri). The drawback to epoprostenol is that its effects last only a few minutes. This drug is continuously injected through an intravenous (IV) catheter via a small pump that you wear in a pack on your belt or shoulder. Potential side effects of epoprostenol include jaw pain, nausea, diarrhea and leg cramps, as well as pain and infection at the IV site. Another form of the drug, iloprost (Ventavis), can be inhaled six to nine times a day through a nebulizer, a machine that vaporizes your medication. Because it's inhaled, it goes directly to the lungs. Side effects associated with iloprost include chest pain - often accompanied by a headache and nausea - and breathlessness. Treprostinil (Tyvaso, Remodulin, Orenitram), another form of the drug, can be given four times a day. It can be inhaled, taken as oral medication or administered by injection. It can cause side effects such as a headache, nausea and diarrhea. - Endothelin receptor antagonists. These medications reverse the effect of endothelin, a substance in the walls of blood vessels that causes them to narrow. These drugs may improve your energy level and symptoms. However, these drugs shouldn't be taken if you're pregnant. Also, these drugs can damage your liver and you may need monthly liver monitoring. These medications include bosentan (Tracleer), macitentan (Opsumit), and ambrisentan (Letairis). - Sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis, Adcirca) are sometimes used to treat pulmonary hypertension. These drugs work by opening the blood vessels in the lungs to allow blood to flow through more easily. Side effects can include an upset stomach, headache and vision problems. - High-dose calcium channel blockers. These drugs help relax the muscles in the walls of your blood vessels. They include medications such as amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and nifedipine (Procardia, others). Although calcium channel blockers can be effective, only a small number of people with pulmonary hypertension respond to them. - Soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) stimulator. Soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) stimulators (Adempas) interact with nitric oxide and help relax the pulmonary arteries and lower the pressure within the arteries. These medications should not be taken if you're pregnant. They can sometimes cause dizziness or nausea. - Anticoagulants. Your doctor is likely to prescribe the anticoagulant warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) to help prevent the formation of blood clots within the small pulmonary arteries. Because anticoagulants prevent normal blood coagulation, they increase your risk of bleeding complications. Take warfarin exactly as prescribed, because warfarin can cause severe side effects if taken incorrectly. If you're taking warfarin, your doctor will ask you to have periodic blood tests to check how well the drug is working. Many other drugs, herbal supplements and foods can interact with warfarin, so be sure your doctor knows all of the medications you're taking. - Digoxin. Digoxin (Lanoxin) can help the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. It can help control the heart rate if you experience arrhythmias. - Diuretics. Commonly known as water pills, these medications help eliminate excess fluid from your body. This reduces the amount of work your heart has to do. They may also be used to limit fluid buildup in your lungs. - Oxygen. Your doctor might suggest that you sometimes breathe pure oxygen, a treatment known as oxygen therapy, to help treat pulmonary hypertension, especially if you live at a high altitude or have sleep apnea. Some people who have pulmonary hypertension eventually require continuous oxygen therapy. Surgeries - Atrial septostomy. If medications don't control your pulmonary hypertension, this open-heart surgery might be an option. In an atrial septostomy, a surgeon will create an opening between the upper left and right chambers of your heart (atria) to relieve the pressure on the right side of your heart. Atrial septostomy can have serious complications, including heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias). - Transplantation. In some cases, a lung or heart-lung transplant might be an option, especially for younger people who have idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Major risks of any type of transplantation include rejection of the transplanted organ and serious infection, and you must take immunosuppressant drugs for life to help reduce the chance of rejection. Although medical treatment can't cure pulmonary hypertension, it can lessen symptoms. Lifestyle changes also can help improve your condition. Consider these tips: - Get plenty of rest. Resting can reduce the fatigue that might come from having pulmonary hypertension. - Stay as active as possible. Even the mildest forms of activity might be too exhausting for some people who have pulmonary hypertension. For others, moderate exercise such as walking might be beneficial - especially when done with oxygen. But first, talk to your doctor about specific exercise restrictions. In most cases, it's recommended that you not lift heavy weights. Your doctor can help you plan an appropriate exercise program. - Don't smoke. If you smoke, the most important thing you can do for your heart and lungs is to stop. If you can't stop smoking by yourself, ask your doctor to prescribe a treatment plan to help you quit. Also, avoid secondhand smoke if possible. - Avoid pregnancy and birth control pills. If you're a woman of childbearing age, avoid pregnancy. Pregnancy can be life-threatening for both you and your baby. Also avoid using birth control pills, which can increase your risk of blood clots. Talk to your doctor about alternative forms of birth control. If you do become pregnant, it's important to consult with your doctor as pulmonary hypertension can cause serious complications to both you and the fetus. - Avoid traveling to or living at high altitudes. High altitudes can worsen the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. If you live at an altitude of 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) or higher, your doctor might recommend that you move to a lower altitude. - Avoid situations that can excessively lower blood pressure. These include sitting in a hot tub or sauna or taking long hot baths or showers. These activities lower your blood pressure and can cause fainting or even death. Also avoid activities that cause prolonged straining, such as lifting heavy objects or weights. - Follow a nutritious diet and stay at a healthy weight. Aim to eat a healthy diet of whole grains, a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean meats and low-fat dairy products. Avoid saturated fat, trans fat and cholesterol. It's likely your doctor will recommend limiting the amount of salt in your diet. Aim to maintain a healthy weight. - Ask your doctor about medications. Take all your medications as prescribed. Ask your doctor about any other medications before taking them, as some can interfere with your medication or worsen your condition. - See your doctor at follow-up appointments. Your doctor may recommend regular follow-up appointments. Let your doctor know if you have any questions about your condition or medications you're taking, or if you have any symptoms or side effects from your medications. If pulmonary hypertension is affecting your quality of life, ask your doctor about options that could improve your quality of life. - Get vaccines. Your doctor may recommend getting an influenza and pneumonia vaccine, as these conditions can cause serious issues for people with pulmonary hypertension. - Get support. If you're feeling stressed or worried due to your condition, get support from family or friends. Or, consider joining a support group with others who have pulmonary hypertension."

It's most commonly caused by a large hole in your heart between the two lower heart chambers (ventricles), called a ventricular septal defect. This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart. Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood). The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension."

        "document": "Pulmonary hypertension (Causes): The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body.   When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension.   The heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, this causes the right side of the heart to become larger. This condition is called right-sided heart failure, or cor pulmonale.   Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by:     - Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis   - Birth defects of the heart   - Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism)   - Heart failure   - Heart valve disease   - HIV infection   - Low oxygen levels in the blood for a long time (chronic)   - Lung disease, such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis   - Medicines (for example, certain diet drugs)   - Obstructive sleep apnea     In rare cases, the cause of pulmonary hypertension is unknown. In this case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Idiopathic means the cause of a disease is not known. IPAH affects more women than men.   If pulmonary hypertension is caused by a known medicine or medical condition, it is called secondary pulmonary hypertension."

        "document": "Pulmonary Hypertension (Types): The World Health Organization divides pulmonary hypertension (PH) into five groups. These groups are organized based on the cause of the condition. In all groups, the average pressure in the pulmonary arteries is higher than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity. The pressure in normal pulmonary arteries is 8\u201320 mmHg at rest. (Note that group 1 is called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and groups 2 through 5 are called pulmonary hypertension. However, together all groups are called pulmonary hypertension.) Group 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Group 1 PAH includes: PAH that has no known cause. PAH that's inherited (passed from parents to children through genes). PAH that's caused by drugs or toxins, such as street drugs and certain diet medicines. PAH that's caused by conditions such as: - Connective tissue diseases. (Connective tissue helps support all parts of your body, including your skin, eyes, and heart.) - HIV infection. - Liver disease. - Congenital heart disease. This is heart disease that's present at birth. - Sickle cell disease. - Schistosomiasis (SKIS-toe-so-MI-ah-sis). This is an infection caused by a parasite. Schistosomiasis is one of the most common causes of PAH in many parts of the world. Connective tissue diseases. (Connective tissue helps support all parts of your body, including your skin, eyes, and heart.) HIV infection. Liver disease. Congenital heart disease. This is heart disease that's present at birth. Sickle cell disease. Schistosomiasis (SKIS-toe-so-MI-ah-sis). This is an infection caused by a parasite. Schistosomiasis is one of the most common causes of PAH in many parts of the world. PAH that's caused by conditions that affect the veins and small blood vessels of the lungs. Group 2 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 2 includes PH with left heart disease. Conditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as mitral valve disease or long-term high blood pressure, can cause left heart disease and PH. Left heart disease is likely the most common cause of PH. Group 3 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 3 includes PH associated with lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial (IN-ter-STISH-al) lung diseases. Interstitial lung diseases cause scarring of the lung tissue. Group 3 also includes PH associated with sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea. Group 4 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 4 includes PH caused by blood clots in the lungs or blood clotting disorders. Group 5 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 5 includes PH caused by various other diseases or conditions. Examples include: Blood disorders, such as polycythemia vera (POL-e-si-THE-me-ah VAY-rah or VE-rah) and essential thrombocythemia (THROM-bo-si-THE-me-ah). Systemic disorders, such as sarcoidosis (sar-koy-DO-sis) and vasculitis (vas-kyu-LI-tis). Systemic disorders involve many of the body's organs. Metabolic disorders, such as thyroid disease and glycogen storage disease. (In glycogen storage disease, the body's cells don't use a form of glucose (sugar) properly.) Other conditions, such as tumors that press on the pulmonary arteries and kidney disease."

        "document": "Tooth abscess: A tooth abscess is a buildup of infected material (pus) in the center of a tooth. It is an infection caused by bacteria. A tooth abscess may form if there is tooth decay. It may also occur when a tooth is broken, chipped, or injured in other ways. Openings in the tooth enamel allow bacteria to infect the center of the tooth (the pulp). Infection may spread from the root of the tooth to the bones supporting the tooth.   Infection results in a buildup of pus and tissue swelling within the tooth. This causes a toothache. The toothache may stop if pressure is relieved. But the infection can remain active and continue to spread. This can cause more pain and can destroy tissue. The main symptom is a severe toothache. The pain is continuous. It does not stop. It can be described as gnawing, sharp, shooting, or throbbing.   Other symptoms may include:      - Bitter taste in the mouth   - Breath odor   - General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling   - Fever   - Pain when chewing   - Sensitivity of the teeth to hot or cold   - Swelling of the gum over the infected tooth, which may look like a pimple   - Swollen glands of the neck   - Swollen area of the upper or lower jaw, which is a very serious symptom Your dentist will closely look at your teeth, mouth, and gums. It may hurt when the dentist taps the tooth. Biting or closing your mouth tightly also increases the pain. Your gums may be swollen and red, and may drain thick material.   Dental x-rays and other tests can help your dentist determine which tooth or teeth are causing the problem. The goals of treatment are to cure the infection, save the tooth, and prevent complications.   Your dentist might prescribe antibiotics to fight the infection. Warm saltwater rinses may help ease the pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers may relieve your toothache and fever.   Do NOT place aspirin directly on your tooth or gums. This increases irritation of the tissues and can result in mouth ulcers.   A root canal may be recommended in an attempt to save the tooth.   If you have a severe infection, your tooth may be removed, or you may need surgery to drain the abscess. Some people may need to be admitted to the hospital. Untreated abscesses may get worse and can lead to life-threatening complications.   Prompt treatment cures the infection in most cases. The tooth can often be saved. These complications can occur:     - Loss of the tooth   - Blood infection   - Spread of infection to soft tissue   - Spread of infection to the jaw bone   - Spread of infection to other areas of the body, which can cause brain abscess, inflammation in the heart, pneumonia, or other complications Call your dentist if you have a throbbing toothache that does not go away, or if you notice a bubble (or \u201cpimple\u201d) on your gums. Prompt treatment of dental decay reduces the risk of tooth abscess. Have your dentist examine any broken or chipped teeth right away.

        "document": "Diabetes: Diabetes is a chronic disease in which the body cannot regulate the amount of sugar in the blood. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.   To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested:     - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.   - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.        People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:     - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin   - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally   - Both of the above      There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:       - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown.   - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should.   - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2.      Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.   If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease. A high blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including:     - Blurry vision   - Excess thirst   - Fatigue   - Frequent urination   - Hunger   - Weight loss      Because type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms.   Symptoms of type 1 diabetes develop over a short period. People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed.   After many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems. These problems are known as diabetes complications, and include:     - Eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), light sensitivity, and blindness   - Sores and infections of the leg or foot, which if untreated, can lead to amputation of the leg or foot   - Damage to nerves in the body, causing pain, tingling, a loss of feeling, problems digesting food, and erectile dysfunction   - Kidney problems, which can lead to kidney failure   - Weakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections   - Increased chance of having a heart attack or stroke A urine analysis may show high blood sugar. But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes.   Your health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done.   Blood tests:     - Fasting blood glucose level. Diabetes is diagnosed if the fasting glucose level is higher than 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) on two different tests. Levels between 100 and 126 mg/dL (5.5 and 7.0 mmol/L) are called impaired fasting glucose or prediabetes. These levels are risk factors for type 2 diabetes.   - Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) test. Normal is less than 5.7%; prediabetes is 5.7% to 6.4%; and diabetes is 6.5% or higher.   - Oral glucose tolerance test. Diabetes is diagnosed if the glucose level is higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) 2 hours after drinking a sugar drink (this test is used more often for type 2 diabetes).      Screening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for:     - Overweight children who have other risk factors for diabetes, starting at age 10 and repeated every 3 years.   - Overweight adults (BMI of 25 or higher) who have other risk factors such as having high blood pressure, or having a mother, father, sister or brother with diabetes.   - Adults over age 45, repeated every 3 years. Type 2 diabetes may be reversed with lifestyle changes, especially losing weight with exercise and by eating healthier foods. Some cases of type 2 diabetes can also be improved with weight loss surgery.   There is no cure for type 1 diabetes.    Treating either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes involves medicines, diet, and exercise to control blood sugar level.   Everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your provider about seeing a diabetes nurse educator.    Getting better control over your blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels helps reduce the risk of kidney disease, eye disease, nervous system disease, heart attack, and stroke.   To prevent diabetes complications, visit your provider at least 2 to 4 times a year. Talk about any problems you are having. Follow your provider's instructions on managing your diabetes. Many resources can help you understand more about diabetes. If you have diabetes, you can also learn ways to manage your condition and prevent diabetes complications. Diabetes is a lifelong disease and there is no cure.   Tight control of blood glucose can prevent or delay diabetes complications. But these problems can occur, even in people with good diabetes control. After many years, diabetes can lead to serious health problems:     - You could have eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), and light sensitivity. You could become blind.   - Your feet and skin can develop sores and infections. After a long time, your foot or leg may need to be amputated. Infection can also cause pain and itching in other parts of the body.   - Diabetes may make it harder to control your blood pressure and cholesterol. This can lead to a heart attack, stroke, and other problems. It can become harder for blood to flow to your legs and feet.   - Nerves in your body can get damaged, causing pain, tingling, and numbness.   - Because of nerve damage, you could have problems digesting the food you eat. You could feel weakness or have trouble going to the bathroom. Nerve damage can make it harder for men to have an erection.   - High blood sugar and other problems can lead to kidney damage. Your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. They may even stop working so that you need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Keeping an ideal body weight and an active lifestyle may prevent or delay the start of type 2 diabetes. If you're overweight, losing just 5% to 7% of your body weight even helps. Some medicines can also be used to delay or prevent the start of type 2 diabetes.   At this time, type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented. But there is promising research that shows type 1 diabetes may be delayed in some high risk people.

More than 8 million people in the United States have type 2 diabetes and dont know it. Many people dont find out they have diabetes until they are faced with problems such as blurry vision or heart trouble. Certain factors can increase your risk for diabetes, and its important to know what they are. Type 1 Diabetes Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. In an autoimmune reaction, antibodies, or immune cells, attach to the bodys own healthy tissues by mistake, signaling the body to attack them. At present, scientists do not know exactly what causes the body's immune system to attack the cells, but many believe that both genetic factors and environmental factors, such as viruses, are involved. Studies are now underway to identify these factors and prevent type 1 diabetes in people at risk.  Learn more about the causes of type 1 diabetes.  Type 2 Diabetes Type 2 diabetes -- the most common form -- is linked closely to overweight and obesity, high blood pressure, and abnormal cholesterol levels. Many people with type 2 diabetes are overweight. Being overweight can keep your body from using insulin properly. Genes also play an important role in a person's risk for type 2 diabetes.

Learn more about the causes of type 2 diabetes.  Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Before people develop type 2 diabetes, they usually have prediabetes -- a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. People with prediabetes are more likely to develop diabetes within 10 years and also are more likely to have a heart attack or stroke. Prediabetes is increasingly common in the U.S. adult population. In 2012, about 86 million people in the U.S. had pre-diabetes, and 51% of those 65 or older had prediabetes. Learn more about prediabetes.  Gestational Diabetes Some women develop diabetes during the late stages of pregnancy. This is called gestational diabetes. Although this form of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born, a woman who has had it has a lifelong risk for developing diabetes, mostly type 2."

        "document": "Type 2 diabetes: Type 2 diabetes is a lifelong (chronic) disease in which there is a high level of sugar (glucose) in the blood. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar (glucose) into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy.    When you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, blood sugar does not get into these cells to be stored for energy.   When sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes.   Type 2 diabetes usually develops slowly over time. Most people with the disease are overweight or obese when they are diagnosed. Increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way.   Type 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are thin. This is more common in older adults.   Family history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes. Low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight around the waist increase your chance of getting the disease. People with type 2 diabetes often have no symptoms at first. They may not have symptoms for many years.   Early symptoms of diabetes caused by a high blood sugar level may include:     - Bladder, kidney, skin, or other infections that are more frequent or heal slowly   - Fatigue   - Hunger   - Increased thirst   - Increased urination   - Blurred vision     After many years, diabetes can lead to serious health problems, and as a result, many other symptoms. Your doctor may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is higher than 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 11.1 mmol/L. To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done.     - Fasting blood glucose level. Diabetes is diagnosed if it is higher than 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) two different times.   - Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) test. Diabetes is diagnosed if the test result is 6.5% or higher.   - Oral glucose tolerance test. Diabetes is diagnosed if the glucose level is higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) 2 hours after drinking a special sugar drink.      Diabetes screening is recommended for:     - Overweight children who have other risk factors for diabetes, starting at age 10 and repeated every 2 years   - Overweight adults (BMI of 25 or higher) who have other risk factors   - Adults starting at age 45 every 3 years, or at a younger age if the person has risk factors      If you have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, you need to work closely with your doctor. See your doctor as often as instructed. This may be every 3 months.   The following exams and tests will help you and your doctor monitor your diabetes and prevent problems.     - Check the skin and bones on your feet and legs.   - Check if your feet are getting numb (diabetic nerve disease).   - Have your blood pressure checked at least once a year (blood pressure goal should be 140/80 mm Hg or lower).   - Have your A1C tested every 6 months if your diabetes is well controlled. Have the test every 3 months if your diabetes is not well controlled.   - Have your cholesterol and triglyceride levels checked once a year.   - Get tests once a year to make sure your kidneys are working well (microalbuminuria and serum creatinine).   - Visit your eye doctor at least once a year, or more often if you have signs of diabetic eye disease.   - See the dentist every 6 months for a thorough dental cleaning and exam. Make sure your dentist and hygienist know that you have diabetes. The goal of treatment at first is to lower your high blood glucose level. Long-term goals are to prevent complications. These are health problems from diabetes.   The most important way to treat and manage type 2 diabetes is by being active and eating healthy foods.   Everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your doctor about seeing a diabetes nurse educator and a dietitian.    LEARN THESE SKILLS   Learning diabetes management skills will help you live well with diabetes. These skills help prevent health problems and the need for medical care. Skills include:     - How to test and record your blood glucose   - What, when, and how much to eat   - How to safely increase your activity and control your weight   - How to take medicines, if needed   - How to recognize and treat low and high blood sugar   - How to handle sick days   - Where to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them      It may take several months to learn these skills. Keep learning about diabetes, its complications, and how to control and live well\u00a0with the disease. Stay up-to-date on new research and treatments.   MANAGING YOUR BLOOD SUGAR   Checking your blood sugar level yourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes. Talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check.   To check your blood sugar level, you use a device called a glucose meter. Usually, you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet. This gives you a tiny drop of blood. You place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. The meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.   Your doctor or diabetes educator will help set up a testing schedule for you. Your doctor will help you set a target range for your blood sugar numbers. Keep these factors in mind:     - Most people with type 2 diabetes only need to check their blood sugar once or twice a day.   - If your blood sugar level is under control, you may only need to check it a few times a week.   - You may test yourself when you wake up, before meals, and at bedtime.   - You may need to test more often when you are sick or under stress.   - You may need to test more often if you are having more frequent low blood sugar symptoms.      Keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor. Based on your numbers, you may need to make changes to your meals, activity, or medicines to keep your blood sugar level in the right range.    HEALTHY EATING AND WEIGHT CONTROL   Work closely with your health care providers to learn how much fat, protein, and carbohydrates you need in your diet. Your meal plans should fit your lifestyle and habits and should include foods that you like.   Managing your weight and having a well-balanced diet are important. Some people with type 2 diabetes can stop taking medicines after losing weight. This does not mean that their diabetes is cured. They still have diabetes.   Very obese people whose diabetes is not well managed with diet and medicine may consider weight loss (bariatric) surgery.   REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY   Regular activity is important for everyone. It is even more important when you have diabetes. Exercise is good for your health because it:     - Lowers your blood sugar level without medicine   - Burns extra calories and fat to help manage your weight   - Improves blood flow and blood pressure   - Increases your energy level   - Improves your ability to handle stress      Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program. People with type 2 diabetes may need to take special steps before, during, and after physical activity or exercise.     MEDICINES TO TREAT DIABETES   If diet and exercise do not help keep your blood sugar at normal or near-normal levels, your doctor may prescribe medicine. Since these drugs help lower your blood sugar level in different ways, your doctor may have you take more than one drug.   Some of the most common types of medicines are listed below. They are taken by mouth or injection.     - Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors   - Biguanides   - DPP IV inhibitors   - Injectable medicines (GLP-1 analogs)   - Meglitinides   - SGL T2 inhibitors   - Sulfonylureas   - Thiazolidinediones      You may need to take insulin if your blood sugar cannot be controlled with any of the above medicines. Most commonly, insulin is injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen, or pump. Another form of insulin is the inhaled type. Insulin cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys the insulin.   PREVENTING COMPLICATIONS   Your doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing some of the more common complications of diabetes, including:      - Eye disease   - Kidney disease   - Heart disease and stroke     FOOT CARE   People with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems. Diabetes damages the nerves. This can make your feet less able to feel pressure, pain, heat, or cold. You may not notice a foot injury until you have severe damage to the skin and tissue below, or you get a severe infection.   Diabetes can also damage blood vessels. Small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers). The affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger, deeper, or infected.   To prevent problems with your feet:     - Stop smoking if you smoke.   - Improve control of your blood sugar.   - Get a foot exam by your doctor at least twice a year to learn if you have nerve damage.   - Check and care for your feet every day. This is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems.   - Treat minor infections, such as athlete's foot, right away.   - Use moisturizing lotion on dry skin.   - Make sure you wear the right kind of shoes. Ask your doctor what type of shoe is right for you. There are many diabetes resources that can help you understand more about type 2 diabetes. You can also learn ways to manage your condition so you can live well with diabetes. Diabetes is a lifelong disease and there is no cure.   Some people with type 2 diabetes no longer need medicine if they lose weight and become more active. When they reach their ideal weight, their body's own insulin and a healthy diet can control their blood sugar level. After many years, diabetes can lead to serious health problems:     - You could have eye problems, including trouble seeing (especially at night), and light sensitivity. You could become blind.   - Your feet and skin can develop sores and infections. After a long time, your foot or leg may need to be amputated. Infection can also cause pain and itching in other parts of the body.   - Diabetes may make it harder to control your blood pressure and cholesterol. This can lead to a heart attack, stroke, and other problems. It can become harder for blood to flow to your legs and feet.   - Nerves in your body can get damaged, causing pain, tingling, and numbness.   - Because of nerve damage, you could have problems digesting the food you eat. You could feel weakness or have trouble going to the bathroom. Nerve damage can make it harder for men to have an erection.   - High blood sugar and other problems can lead to kidney damage. Your kidneys may not work as well as they used to. They may even stop working so that you need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Call 911 right away if you have:     - Chest pain or pressure   - Fainting, confusion or unconsciousness   - Seizure   - Shortness of breath      These symptoms can quickly get worse and become emergency conditions (such as convulsions, hypoglycemic coma or hyperglycemic coma).   Also call your doctor if you have:     - Numbness, tingling, or pain in your feet or legs   - Problems with your eyesight   - Sores or infections on your feet   - Symptoms of high blood sugar (extreme thirst, blurry vision, dry skin, weakness or fatigue, the need to urinate a lot)   - Symptoms of low blood sugar (weakness or fatigue, trembling, sweating, irritability, trouble thinking clearly, fast heartbeat, double or blurry vision, uneasy feeling) You can help prevent type 2 diabetes by staying at a healthy body weight. You can get to a healthy weight by eating healthy foods, controlling your portion sizes, and leading an active lifestyle. Some medicines can also delay or prevent type 2 diabetes in people at risk of developing the disease.

        "document": "Type 2 diabetes (Risk factors): Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear, however, that certain factors increase the risk, including: - Weight. Being overweight is a primary risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. However, you don't have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes.   - Fat distribution. If your body stores fat primarily in your abdomen, your risk of type 2 diabetes is greater than if your body stores fat elsewhere, such as your hips and thighs.   - Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk of type 2 diabetes. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin.   - Family history. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases if your parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes.   - Race. Although it's unclear why, people of certain races - including blacks, Hispanics, American Indians and Asian-Americans - are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than whites are.   - Age. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases as you get older, especially after age 45. That's probably because people tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as they age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing dramatically among children, adolescents and younger adults.   - Prediabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Left untreated, prediabetes often progresses to type 2 diabetes.   - Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes.   - Polycystic ovarian syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovarian syndrome - a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity - increases the risk of diabetes."

As a result, the condition can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. For people born before newborn screening was performed, it's important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis signs and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or improve as time passes. Some people may not experience symptoms until adolescence or adulthood. People with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis affect the respiratory system and digestive system. However, adults diagnosed with cystic fibrosis are more likely to have atypical symptoms, such as recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), infertility and recurring pneumonia. The thick and sticky mucus associated with cystic fibrosis clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. This can cause signs and symptoms such as: - A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum)   - Wheezing   - Breathlessness   - Exercise intolerance   - Repeated lung infections   - Inflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose The thick mucus can also block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your small intestine. Without these digestive enzymes, your intestines aren't able to completely absorb the nutrients in the food you eat. The result is often: - Foul-smelling, greasy stools   - Poor weight gain and growth   - Intestinal blockage, particularly in newborns (meconium ileus)   - Severe constipation Frequent straining while passing stool can cause part of the rectum - the end of the large intestine - to protrude outside the anus (rectal prolapse). When this occurs in children, it may be a sign of cystic fibrosis. Parents should consult a physician knowledgeable about cystic fibrosis. Rectal prolapse in children may sometimes require surgery. Rectal prolapse in children with cystic fibrosis is less common than it was in the past, which may be due to earlier testing, diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis. If you or your child has symptoms of cystic fibrosis - or if someone in your family has cystic fibrosis - talk with your doctor about testing for the disease.

        "document": "Cystic fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body. Cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive juices. These secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery. But in people with cystic fibrosis, a defective gene causes the secretions to become sticky and thick. Instead of acting as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts and passageways, especially in the lungs and pancreas. Although cystic fibrosis requires daily care, people with the condition are usually able to attend school and work, and often have a better quality of life than people with cystic fibrosis had in previous decades. Improvements in screening and treatments mean people with cystic fibrosis now may live into their mid- to late 30s, on average, and some are living into their 40s and 50s. Cystic fibrosis care at Mayo Clinic Screening of newborns for cystic fibrosis is now performed in every state in the United States. As a result, the condition can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. For people born before newborn screening was performed, it's important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis.

Rectal prolapse in children with cystic fibrosis is less common than it was in the past, which may be due to earlier testing, diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis. If you or your child has symptoms of cystic fibrosis - or if someone in your family has cystic fibrosis - talk with your doctor about testing for the disease. Seek immediate medical care if you or your child has difficulty breathing. In cystic fibrosis, a defect (mutation) in a gene changes a protein that regulates the movement of salt in and out of cells. The result is thick, sticky mucus in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as increased salt in sweat. Many different defects can occur in the gene. The type of gene mutation is associated with the severity of the condition. Children need to inherit one copy of the gene from each parent in order to have the disease. If children inherit only one copy, they won't develop cystic fibrosis. However, they will be carriers and possibly pass the gene to their own children. - Family history. Because cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder, it runs in families.   - Race. Although cystic fibrosis occurs in all races, it is most common in white people of Northern European ancestry. - Damaged airways (bronchiectasis). Cystic fibrosis is one of the leading causes of bronchiectasis, a condition that damages the airways. This makes it harder to move air in and out of the lungs and clear mucus from the airways (bronchial tubes).   - Chronic infections. Thick mucus in the lungs and sinuses provides an ideal breeding ground for bacteria and fungi. People with cystic fibrosis may often have sinus infections, bronchitis or pneumonia.   - Growths in the nose (nasal polyps). Because the lining inside the nose is inflamed and swollen, it can develop soft, fleshy growths (polyps).   - Coughing up blood (hemoptysis). Over time, cystic fibrosis can cause thinning of the airway walls. As a result, teenagers and adults with cystic fibrosis may cough up blood.   - Pneumothorax. This condition, in which air collects in the space that separates the lungs from the chest wall, also is more common in older people with cystic fibrosis. Pneumothorax can cause chest pain and breathlessness.   - Respiratory failure. Over time, cystic fibrosis can damage lung tissue so badly that it no longer works. Lung function usually worsens gradually, and it eventually can become life-threatening.   - Acute exacerbations. People with cystic fibrosis may experience worsening of their respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath, for several days to weeks. This is called an acute exacerbation and requires treatment in the hospital. - Nutritional deficiencies. Thick mucus can block the tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your intestines. Without these enzymes, your body can't absorb protein, fats or fat-soluble vitamins.   - Diabetes. The pancreas produces insulin, which your body needs to use sugar. Cystic fibrosis increases the risk of diabetes. Around 30 percent of people with cystic fibrosis develop diabetes by age 30.   - Blocked bile duct. The tube that carries bile from your liver and gallbladder to your small intestine may become blocked and inflamed, leading to liver problems and sometimes gallstones.   - Intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction can happen to people with cystic fibrosis at all ages. Children and adults with cystic fibrosis are more likely than are infants to develop intussusception, a condition in which a section of the intestines folds in on itself like an accordion.   - Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). DIOS is partial or complete obstruction where the small intestine meets the large intestine. Almost all men with cystic fibrosis are infertile because the tube that connects the testes and prostate gland (vas deferens) is either blocked with mucus or missing entirely. Certain fertility treatments and surgical procedures sometimes make it possible for men with cystic fibrosis to become biological fathers. Although women with cystic fibrosis may be less fertile than other women, it's possible for them to conceive and to have successful pregnancies. Still, pregnancy can worsen the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis, so be sure to discuss the possible risks with your doctor. - Thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). People with cystic fibrosis are at higher risk of developing a dangerous thinning of bones.   - Electrolyte imbalances and dehydration. Because people with cystic fibrosis have saltier sweat, the balance of minerals in their blood may be upset. Signs and symptoms include increased heart rate, fatigue, weakness and low blood pressure. To diagnose cystic fibrosis, doctors may conduct several tests. Newborn screening and diagnosis Every state in the U.S. now routinely screens newborns for cystic fibrosis. Early diagnosis means treatment can begin immediately. In one screening test, a blood sample is checked for higher than normal levels of a chemical (immunoreactive trypsinogen, or IRT) released by the pancreas. A newborn's IRT levels may be high because of premature birth or a stressful delivery. For that reason other tests may be needed to confirm a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Genetic tests may be used in addition to checking the IRT levels to confirm the diagnosis. Doctors may also conduct genetic tests to test for specific defects on the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. To evaluate if an infant has cystic fibrosis, doctors may also conduct a sweat test when the infant is at least 2 weeks old. In a sweat test, doctors apply a sweat-producing chemical to a small area of skin. They then collect the sweat to test it and see if it's saltier than normal. Testing may be done at a center specializing in cystic fibrosis. Testing of older children and adults Cystic fibrosis tests may be recommended for older children and adults who weren't screened at birth. Your doctor may suggest genetic and sweat tests for cystic fibrosis if you have recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), nasal polyps, chronic sinus or lung infections, bronchiectasis, or male infertility. There is no cure for cystic fibrosis, but treatment can ease symptoms and reduce complications. Close monitoring and early, aggressive intervention is recommended. Managing cystic fibrosis is complex, so consider obtaining treatment at a center staffed by doctors and other staff trained in cystic fibrosis. Doctors may work with a multidisciplinary team of doctors and medical professionals trained in cystic fibrosis to evaluate and treat your condition. The goals of treatment include: - Preventing and controlling infections that occur in the lungs - Removing and loosening mucus from the lungs - Treating and preventing intestinal blockage - Providing adequate nutrition Medications The options may include: - Antibiotics to treat and prevent lung infections - Anti-inflammatory medications to lessen swelling in the airways in your lungs - Mucus-thinning drugs to help you cough up the mucus, which can improve lung function - Inhaled medications called bronchodilators that can help keep your airways open by relaxing the muscles around your bronchial tubes - Oral pancreatic enzymes to help your digestive tract absorb nutrients For those with cystic fibrosis who have certain gene mutations, doctors may recommend a newer medication called ivacaftor (Kalydeco). This medication may improve lung function and weight, and reduce the amount of salt in sweat. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for people with cystic fibrosis who are age 6 and older. The dose depends on your weight and age. Doctors may conduct liver function tests and eye examinations before prescribing ivacaftor and on a regular basis while you're taking it to check for side effects such as liver function abnormalities and cataracts. For people with a certain gene mutation who are age 12 and older, another drug (Orkambi) is available that combines ivacaftor with a medication called lumacaftor. The combination of these medications may improve lung function and reduce the risk of exacerbations. However, some people may experience side effects such as chest discomfort and shortness of breath soon after starting the medication. Some people may also have high blood pressure while taking the medication. Doctors may monitor you for any side effects. Chest physical therapy Loosening the thick mucus in the lungs makes it easier to cough up. Chest physical therapy helps loosen mucus. It is usually done from one to four times a day. A common technique is clapping with cupped hands on the front and back of the chest. Certain breathing techniques also may be used to help loosen the mucus. Your doctor will instruct you about the type of chest physical therapy he or she recommends for you. Mechanical devices also can help loosen lung mucus. These include a vibrating vest or a tube or mask you breathe into. Pulmonary rehabilitation Your doctor may recommend a long-term program that may improve your lung function and overall well-being. Pulmonary rehabilitation is usually done on an outpatient basis and may include: - Physical exercise that may improve your condition - Breathing techniques that may help loosen mucus and improve breathing - Nutritional counseling - Counseling and support - Education about your condition Surgical and other procedures - Nasal polyp removal. Your doctor may recommend surgery to remove nasal polyps that obstruct breathing. - Oxygen therapy. If your blood oxygen level declines, your doctor may recommend that you breathe pure oxygen to prevent high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). - Endoscopy and lavage. Mucus may be suctioned from obstructed airways through an endoscope. - Feeding tube. Cystic fibrosis interferes with digestion, so you can't absorb nutrients from food very well. Your doctor may suggest temporarily using a feeding tube to deliver extra nutrition while you sleep. This tube may be inserted in your nose and guided to your stomach, or it may be surgically implanted into the abdomen. - Bowel surgery. If a blockage develops in your bowel, you may need surgery to remove it. Intussusception, where a section of bowel has folded in on itself, also may require surgical repair. - Lung transplant. If you have severe breathing problems, life-threatening lung complications or increasing resistance to antibiotics used to treat lung infections, lung transplantation may be an option. Because bacteria line the airways in diseases that cause permanent widening of the large airways (bronchiectasis), such as cystic fibrosis, both lungs need to be replaced. Cystic fibrosis does not recur in transplanted lungs. However, other complications associated with cystic fibrosis - such as sinus infections, diabetes, pancreas problems and osteoporosis - can still occur after a lung transplant. You can manage your condition and minimize complications in several ways. Always talk to your doctor before starting home remedies. Cystic fibrosis can cause malnourishment because the enzymes needed for digestion can't reach your small intestine, preventing food from being absorbed. People with cystic fibrosis may need a significantly higher number of calories daily than do people without the condition. A healthy diet is important to maintain good lung function. It's also important to drink lots of fluids, which can help thin the mucus in your lungs. You may work with a dietitian to develop a nutrition plan. Most people with cystic fibrosis need to take pancreatic enzyme capsules with every meal and snack. In addition, your doctor may recommend: - Antacids - Supplemental high-calorie nutrition - Special fat-soluble vitamins - Extra fiber to prevent intestinal blockage - Extra salt, especially during hot weather or before exercising - Adequate water during hot weather In addition to other usual childhood vaccines, people with cystic fibrosis should have the annual flu vaccine and any other vaccines their doctor recommends. Cystic fibrosis doesn't affect the immune system, but children with cystic fibrosis are more likely to develop complications when they become sick. Regular exercise helps loosen mucus in your airways, and strengthens your heart. For many people with cystic fibrosis, participating in sports can improve confidence and self-esteem. Anything that gets you moving, including walking and biking, can help. Don't smoke in your home or car, and don't allow other people to smoke around you or your child. Secondhand smoke is harmful for everyone, but especially for people with cystic fibrosis. Teach all the members of your family to wash their hands thoroughly before eating, after using the bathroom, when coming home from work or school, and after being around a person who is sick. Hand-washing is the best way to protect against infection. You'll have ongoing care from your doctor and other medical professionals. Make sure to attend your regular follow-up appointments. Take your medications as prescribed and follow therapies as instructed. Contact your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms such as severe constipation, more mucus than usual, blood in your mucus or reduced energy."

        "document": "What are the symptoms of Prostate Cancer?: Symptoms Most cancers in their early, most treatable stages don't cause any symptoms. Early prostate cancer usually does not cause symptoms. However, if prostate cancer develops and is not treated, it can cause these symptoms: - a need to urinate frequently, especially at night  - difficulty starting urination or holding back urine  - inability to urinate  - weak or interrupted flow of urine  - painful or burning urination  - difficulty in having an erection  - painful ejaculation  - blood in urine or semen  - pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs. a need to urinate frequently, especially at night difficulty starting urination or holding back urine inability to urinate weak or interrupted flow of urine painful or burning urination difficulty in having an erection painful ejaculation blood in urine or semen pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs. Any of these symptoms may be caused by cancer, but more often they are due to enlargement of the prostate, which is not cancer. If You Have Symptoms If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor or a urologist to find out if you need treatment. A urologist is a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the genitourinary system. The doctor will ask questions about your medical history and perform an exam to try to find the cause of the prostate problems. The PSA Test The doctor may also suggest a blood test to check your prostate specific antigen, or PSA, level. PSA levels can be high not only in men who have prostate cancer, but also in men with an enlarged prostate gland and men with infections of the prostate. PSA tests may be very useful for early cancer diagnosis. However, PSA tests alone do not always tell whether or not cancer is present. PSA screening for prostate cancer is not perfect. (Screening tests check for disease in a person who shows no symptoms.) Most men with mildly elevated PSA do not have prostate cancer, and many men with prostate cancer have normal levels of PSA. A recent study revealed that men with low prostate specific antigen levels, or PSA, may still have prostate cancer. Also, the digital rectal exam can miss many prostate cancers. Other Tests The doctor may order other exams, including ultrasound, MRI, or CT scans, to learn more about the cause of the symptoms. But to confirm the presence of cancer, doctors must perform a biopsy. During a biopsy, the doctor uses needles to remove small tissue samples from the prostate and then looks at the samples under a microscope. If Cancer is Present If a biopsy shows that cancer is present, the doctor will report on the grade of the tumor. Doctors describe a tumor as low, medium, or high-grade cancer, based on the way it appears under the microscope. One way of grading prostate cancer, called the Gleason system, uses scores of 2 to 10. Another system uses G1 through G4. The higher the score, the higher the grade of the tumor. High-grade tumors grow more quickly and are more likely to spread than low-grade tumors."

        "document": "ataxia with vitamin E deficiency: Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency is a disorder that impairs the body's ability to use vitamin E obtained from the diet. Vitamin E is an antioxidant, which means that it protects cells in the body from the damaging effects of unstable molecules called free radicals. A shortage (deficiency) of vitamin E can lead to neurological problems, such as difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia) and speech (dysarthria), loss of reflexes in the legs (lower limb areflexia), and a loss of sensation in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy). Some people with this condition have developed an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa that causes vision loss. Most people who have ataxia with vitamin E deficiency start to experience problems with movement between the ages of 5 and 15 years. The movement problems tend to worsen with age. Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency is a rare condition; however, its prevalence is unknown. Mutations in the TTPA gene cause ataxia with vitamin E deficiency. The TTPA gene provides instructions for making the \u03b1-tocopherol transfer protein (\u03b1TTP), which is found in the liver and brain. This protein controls distribution of vitamin E obtained from the diet (also called \u03b1-tocopherol) to cells and tissues throughout the body. Vitamin E helps cells prevent damage that might be done by free radicals.   TTPA gene mutations impair the activity of the \u03b1TTP protein, resulting in an inability to retain and use dietary vitamin E. As a result, vitamin E levels in the blood are greatly reduced and free radicals accumulate within cells. Nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) are particularly vulnerable to the damaging effects of free radicals and these cells die off when they are deprived of vitamin E. Nerve cell damage can lead to problems with movement and other features of ataxia with vitamin E deficiency. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

Symptoms typically begin during childhood or adolescence and worsen with age, resulting in the need for a wheelchair by early adulthood. AVED is caused by a mutation to the TTPA gene . When this gene is damaged, vitamin E cannot be distributed throughout the body. Vitamin E is important because it protects the cells of the neurological system (neurons) from dangerous molecules called free radicals. AVED is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment for AVED includes vitamin E supplements, which will prevent AVED from developing if given before symptoms begin and may reverse some neurological symptoms if begun after AVED develops. [1] [2] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

AVED may be suspected in individuals who have the following findings at the beginning of puberty: [2] Progressive ataxia Clumsiness of the hands Loss of the ability to know where one's body is in space (proprioception) Absent reflexes (areflexia) The inability to perform rapid, alternating movements (dysdiadochokinesia) A tendency to sway or fall while standing upright with the feet together, arms stretched out and the eyes closed (positive Romberg sign) A nodding movement of the head (titubation) Decreased visual sharpness (acuity) Positive Babinski sign (upward movement of the big toe and fanning of the feet after the sole of the foot has been firmly stroked) Macular atrophy (wasting away of the cells that form the part of our eye responsible for central vision) Retinitis pigmentosa\u00a0( eye disease in which there is damage to the retina) Laboratory studies typically show a reduced plasma vitamin E concentration but normal levels of lipoproteins ( proteins that combine with and transport fat or other lipids in the blood). Other studies that may be useful include: nerve conduction studies, brain imaging , and studies of nerve tissues . [2] [3] Although no universal diagnostic guidelines are available, researchers suggest that diseases that cause fat malabsorption, such as abetalipoproteinemia should be ruled out. Genetic testing finding two TTPA gene mutations may be useful to confirm the diagnosis. [2] [3] Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition. The intended audience for the GTR is health care providers and researchers. Patients and consumers with specific questions about a genetic test should contact a health care provider or a genetics professional. Treatment for AVED requires lifelong high dose supplementation of vitamin E.\u00a0When treated early, some symptoms, such as ataxia and intellectual decline, can be reversed. In older patients, treatment may slow disease progression, but some symptoms remain. [2] [3] Research indicates that if vitamin E treatment is initiated in presymptomatic individuals with two mutations in the TTPA\u00a0 gene (e.g., younger sibs of an affected individual), the symptoms of AVED will not develop. [2] Management Guidelines GeneReviews provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application of genetic testing to the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with specific inherited conditions."

        "document": "Headache: A headache is pain or discomfort in the head, scalp, or neck. Serious causes of headaches are rare. Most people with headaches can feel much better by making lifestyle changes, learning ways to relax, and sometimes by taking medicines. The most common type of headache is tension headache. It is likely caused by tight muscles in your shoulders, neck, scalp, and jaw. A tension headache:      - May be related to stress, depression, anxiety, a head injury, or holding your head and neck in an abnormal position.   - Tends to be on both sides of your head. It often starts at the back of the head and spreads forward. The pain may feel dull or squeezing, like a tight band or vice. Your shoulders, neck, or jaw may feel tight or sore.      A migraine headache involves severe pain. It usually occurs with other symptoms, such as vision changes, sensitivity to sound or light, or nausea. With a migraine:      - The pain may be throbbing, pounding, or pulsating. It tends to begin on one side of your head. It may spread to both sides.   - The headache may be associated with an aura. This is a group of warning symptoms that start before your headache. The pain usually gets worse as you try to move around.   - Migraines may be triggered by foods, such as chocolate, certain cheeses, or monosodium glutamate (MSG). Caffeine withdrawal, lack of sleep, and alcohol may also be triggers.      Rebound headaches are headaches that keep coming back. They often occur from overuse of pain medicines. For this reason, these headaches are also called medicine overuse headaches. People who take pain medicine more than 3 days a week on a regular basis can develop this type of headache.   Other types of headaches:     - Cluster headache is a sharp, very painful headache that occurs daily, sometimes up to several times a day for months. It then goes away for weeks to months. In some people, the headaches never come back. The headache usually lasts less than an hour. It tends to occur at the same times every day.   - Sinus headache causes pain in the front of the head and face. It is due to swelling in the sinus passages behind the cheeks, nose, and eyes. The pain is worse when you bend forward and when you first wake up in the morning.   - Headaches may occur if you have a cold, the flu, a fever, or premenstrual syndrome.   - Headache due to a disorder called temporal arteritis. This is a swollen, inflamed artery that supplies blood to part of the head, temple, and neck area.      In rare cases, a headache can be a sign of something more serious, such as:     - Bleeding in the area between the brain and the thin tissue that covers the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage)   - Blood pressure that is very high   - Brain infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis, or abscess   - Brain tumor   - Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (hydrocephalus)   - Buildup of pressure inside the skull that appears to be, but is not a tumor (pseudotumor cerebri)   - Carbon monoxide poisoning   - Lack of oxygen during sleep (sleep apnea)   - Problems with the blood vessels and bleeding in the brain, such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM), brain aneurysm, or stroke There are things you can do to manage headaches at home, especially migraines or tension headaches. Try to treat the symptoms right away.    When migraine symptoms begin:     - Drink water to avoid getting dehydrated, especially if you have vomited.   - Rest in a quiet, dark room.   - Place a cool cloth on your head.   - Use any relaxation techniques you have learned.      A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. When you get a headache, write down the following:     - Day and time the pain began   - What you ate and drank over the past 24 hours   - How much you slept   - What you were doing and where you were right before the pain started   - How long the headache lasted and what made it stop      Review your diary with your health care provider to identify triggers or a pattern to your headaches. This can help you and your provider create a treatment plan. Knowing your triggers can help you avoid them.    Your provider may have already prescribed medicine to treat your type of headache. If so, take the medicine as instructed.   For tension headaches, try acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen. Talk to your doctor if you are taking pain medicines 3 or more days a week. Some headaches may be a sign of a more serious illness. Seek medical help right away for any of the following:     - This is the first headache you have ever had in your life and it interferes with your daily activities.   - Your headache comes on suddenly and is explosive or violent.   - Your headache is \"the worst ever,\" even if you regularly get headaches.   - You also have slurred speech, a change in vision, problems moving your arms or legs, loss of balance, confusion, or memory loss with your headache.   - Your headache gets worse over 24 hours.   - You also have a fever, stiff neck, nausea, and vomiting with your headache.   - Your headache occurs with a head injury.   - Your headache is severe and just in one eye, with redness in that eye.   - You just started getting headaches, especially if you are older than 50.   - Your headaches are associated with vision problems, pain while chewing, or weight loss.   - You have a history of cancer or immune system problem (such as HIV/AIDS) and develop a new headache. Your provider will take a medical history and will examine your head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, and nervous system.   Your provider will ask many questions to learn about your headaches. Diagnosis is usually based on your history of symptoms.   Tests may include:     - Blood tests or a lumbar puncture if you may have an infection   - Head CT scan or MRI if you have any danger signs or you have been having headaches for a while   - Sinus x-rays   - CT or MR angiography Updated by: Joseph V.

        "document": "Headaches in children: Headaches in children are common and usually aren't serious. Like adults, children can develop different types of headaches, including migraine or stress-related (tension) headaches. Children can also have chronic daily headaches. In some cases, headaches in children are caused by an infection, high levels of stress or anxiety, or minor head trauma. It's important to pay attention to your child's headache symptoms and consult a doctor if the headache worsens or occurs frequently. Headaches in children usually can be treated with over-the-counter pain medications and other lifestyle measures. Children get the same types of headaches adults do, but their symptoms may differ. For example, migraine pain in children may last less than four hours, whereas in adults, migraines last at least four hours. Differences in symptoms may make it difficult to pinpoint headache type in a child, especially in a younger child who can't describe symptoms. In general, though, certain symptoms tend to fall more frequently under certain categories. Migraines can cause: - Pulsating, throbbing or pounding head pain   - Pain that worsens with exertion   - Nausea   - Vomiting   - Abdominal pain   - Extreme sensitivity to light and sound Even infants can have migraines. A child who's too young to tell you what's wrong may cry and hold his or her head to indicate severe pain. Tension-type headaches can cause: - A pressing tightness in the muscles of the head or neck   - Mild to moderate, nonpulsating pain on both sides of the head   - Pain that's not worsened by physical activity   - Headache that's not accompanied by nausea or vomiting, as is often the case with migraine Younger children may withdraw from regular play and want to sleep more. Tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to several days. Cluster headaches are uncommon in children under 10 years of age. They usually: - Occur in groups of five or more episodes, ranging from one headache every other day to eight a day   - Involve sharp, stabbing pain on one side of the head that lasts less than three hours   - Are accompanied by teariness, congestion, runny nose, or restlessness or agitation Doctors use the phrase \"chronic daily headache\" (CDH) for migraine headaches and tension-type headaches that occur more than 15 days a month. CDH may be caused by an infection, minor head injury or taking pain medications - even nonprescription pain medications - too often. Most headaches aren't serious, but seek prompt medical care if your child's headaches: - Wake your child from sleep   - Worsen or become more frequent   - Change your child's personality   - Follow an injury, such as a blow to the head    - Feature persistent vomiting or visual changes   - Are accompanied by fever and neck pain or stiffness A number of factors can cause your child to develop headaches. Factors include: - Illness and infection. Common illnesses such as colds, flu, and ear and sinus infections are some of the most frequent causes of headaches in children. More-serious infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis, also can cause headaches, but are usually accompanied by other signs and symptoms, such as fever and neck stiffness.   - Head trauma. Bumps and bruises can cause headaches. Although most head injuries are minor, seek prompt medical attention if your child falls hard on his or her head or gets hit hard in the head. Also, contact a doctor if your child's head pain steadily worsens after a head injury.   - Emotional factors. Stress and anxiety - perhaps triggered by problems with peers, teachers or parents - can play a role in children's headaches. Children with depression may complain of headaches, particularly if they have trouble recognizing feelings of sadness and loneliness.   - Genetic predisposition. Headaches, particularly migraines, tend to run in families.   - Certain foods and beverages. Nitrates - a food preservative found in cured meats, such as bacon, bologna and hot dogs - can trigger headaches, as can the food additive MSG. Also, too much caffeine - contained in soda, chocolates, coffees and teas - can cause headaches.   - Problems in the brain. Rarely, a brain tumor or abscess or bleeding in the brain can press on areas of the brain, causing a chronic, worsening headache. Typically in these cases, however, there are other symptoms, such as visual problems, dizziness and lack of coordination. Any child can develop headaches, but they're more common in: - Girls after they reach puberty   - Children who have a family history of headaches or migraines   - Older teens To learn about the nature of your child's headache, your doctor will likely look to: - Headache history. Your doctor asks you and your child to describe the headaches in detail, to see if there's a pattern or a common trigger. Your doctor may also ask you to keep a headache diary for a time, so you can record more details about your child's headaches, such as frequency, severity of pain and possible triggers. - Physical exam. The doctor performs a physical exam, including measuring your child's height, weight, head circumference, blood pressure and pulse, and examining your child's eyes, neck, head, shoulders and spine. - Neurological exam. Your doctor checks for any problems with movement, coordination or sensation. If your child is otherwise healthy and headaches are the only symptom, no further testing usually is needed. In a few cases, however, imaging scans and other evaluations can help pinpoint a diagnosis or rule out other medical conditions that could be causing the headaches. These tests may include: - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. This imaging procedure uses a series of computer-directed X-rays that provide a cross-sectional view of your child's brain. This helps doctors diagnose tumors, infections and other medical problems that can cause headaches. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRIs use a powerful magnet to produce detailed views of the brain. MRI scans help doctors diagnose tumors, strokes, aneurysms, neurological diseases and other brain abnormalities. An MRI can also be used to examine the blood vessels that supply the brain. - Spinal tap (lumbar puncture). If your doctor suspects that an underlying condition, such as bacterial or viral meningitis, is causing your child's headaches, he or she may recommend a spinal tap (lumbar puncture). In this procedure, a thin needle is inserted between two vertebrae in the lower back to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid for laboratory analysis. Usually you can treat your child's headache at home with rest, decreased noise, plenty of fluids, balanced meals and over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers. If your child is older and has frequent headaches, learning to relax and manage stress through different forms of therapy may help, as well. Medications - OTC pain relievers. Acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) can typically relieve headaches for your child. They should be taken at the first sign of a headache. Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin is approved for use in children older than age 2, children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. Aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns. - Prescription medications. Triptans, prescription drugs used to treat migraines, are effective and can be used safely in children older than 6 years of age. If your child experiences nausea and vomiting with migraines, your doctor may prescribe an anti-nausea drug. The medication strategy differs from child to child, however. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about nausea relief. Caution: Overuse of medications is itself a contributing factor to headaches (rebound headache). Over time, painkillers and other medications may lose their effectiveness. In addition, all medications have side effects. If your child takes medications regularly, including products you buy over-the-counter, discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor. Therapies While stress doesn't appear to cause headaches, it can act as a trigger for headaches or make a headache worse. Depression and other mental health disorders also can play a role. For these situations, your doctor may recommend one or more behavior therapies, such as: - Relaxation training. Relaxation techniques include deep breathing, yoga, meditation and progressive muscle relaxation, which is accomplished by tensing one muscle at a time, and then completely releasing the tension, until every muscle in the body is relaxed. An older child can learn relaxation techniques in classes or at home using books or tapes. - Biofeedback training. Biofeedback teaches your child to control certain body responses that help reduce pain. During a biofeedback session, your child is connected to devices that monitor and give feedback on body functions, such as muscle tension, heart rate and blood pressure. Your child then learns how to reduce muscle tension and slow his or her heart rate and breathing. The goal of biofeedback is to help your child enter a relaxed state to better cope with pain. - Cognitive behavioral therapy. This therapy can help your child learn to manage stress and reduce the frequency and severity of headaches. During this type of talk therapy, a counselor helps your child learn ways to view and cope with life events more positively. OTC pain medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), are usually effective in reducing headache pain. Before giving your child pain medication, keep these points in mind: - Read labels carefully and use only the dosages recommended for your child. - Don't give doses more frequently than recommended. - Don't give your child OTC pain medication more than two or three days a week. Daily use can trigger a rebound headache, a type of headache caused by overuse of pain medications. - Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin is approved for use in children older than age 2, children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. This is because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns. In addition to OTC pain medications, the following can help ease your child's headache: - Rest and relaxation. Encourage your child to rest in a dark, quiet room. Sleeping often resolves headaches in children. - Use a cool, wet compress. While your child rests, place a cool, wet cloth on his or her forehead. - Offer a healthy snack. If your child hasn't eaten in a while, offer a piece of fruit, whole-wheat crackers or low-fat cheese. Not eating can make headaches worse. Although they haven't been well-studied, a number of dietary supplements have been suggested to help children's headaches, including: - Magnesium - Coenzyme Q10 - Vitamin D - Melatonin Check with your child's doctor before trying any herbal products or dietary supplements to be sure they won't interact with your child's medicine or have harmful side effects. Several alternative treatments may also be helpful for headaches in children, including: - Acupuncture. Acupuncture practitioners use extremely thin, disposable needles that generally cause little pain or discomfort. Some research has suggested that this treatment may help relieve headache symptoms. - Massage. Massage can help reduce stress and relieve tension, and may help ease headaches."

        "document": "Pulmonary Hypertension (Causes): Pulmonary hypertension (PH) begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH. Many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of PH. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may have no known cause, or the condition may be inherited. (\"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) Some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 PAH. Examples include HIV infection, congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease. Also, the use of street drugs (such as cocaine) and certain diet medicines can lead to PAH. Many diseases and conditions can cause groups 2 through 5 PH (often called secondary PH), including: Mitral valve disease Lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Sleep apnea Sarcoidosis For more information about the types of PH and the diseases, conditions, and factors that can cause them, go to \"Types of Pulmonary Hypertension.\""

        "document": "Pulmonary hypertension (Causes): The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body.   When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension.   The heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, this causes the right side of the heart to become larger. This condition is called right-sided heart failure, or cor pulmonale.   Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by:     - Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis   - Birth defects of the heart   - Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism)   - Heart failure   - Heart valve disease   - HIV infection   - Low oxygen levels in the blood for a long time (chronic)   - Lung disease, such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis   - Medicines (for example, certain diet drugs)   - Obstructive sleep apnea     In rare cases, the cause of pulmonary hypertension is unknown. In this case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Idiopathic means the cause of a disease is not known. IPAH affects more women than men.   If pulmonary hypertension is caused by a known medicine or medical condition, it is called secondary pulmonary hypertension."

        "document": "Pulmonary hypertension: Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in your lungs and the right side of your heart. In one form of pulmonary hypertension, tiny arteries in your lungs, called pulmonary arterioles, and capillaries become narrowed, blocked or destroyed. This makes it harder for blood to flow through your lungs, and raises pressure within your lungs' arteries. As the pressure builds, your heart's lower right chamber (right ventricle) must work harder to pump blood through your lungs, eventually causing your heart muscle to weaken and fail. Some forms of pulmonary hypertension are serious conditions that become progressively worse and are sometimes fatal. Although some forms of pulmonary hypertension aren't curable, treatment can help lessen symptoms and improve your quality of life. The signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension in its early stages might not be noticeable for months or even years. As the disease progresses, symptoms become worse. Pulmonary hypertension symptoms include: - Shortness of breath (dyspnea), initially while exercising and eventually while at rest   - Fatigue   - Dizziness or fainting spells (syncope)   - Chest pressure or pain   - Swelling (edema) in your ankles, legs and eventually in your abdomen (ascites)   - Bluish color to your lips and skin (cyanosis)   - Racing pulse or heart palpitations Your heart has two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery). In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart. Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs. With pulmonary hypertension, the rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, and extra tissue may form. The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight. These changes in the pulmonary arteries can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels. This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, depending on the cause. Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension - Cause unknown, known as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension   - A specific gene mutation that can cause pulmonary hypertension to develop in families, also called heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension   - Certain drugs - such as certain prescription diet drugs or illegal drugs such as methamphetamines - or certain toxins   - Heart abnormalities present at birth (congenital heart disease)   - Other conditions, such as connective tissue disorders (scleroderma, lupus, others), HIV infection or chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension caused by left-sided heart disease - Left-sided valvular heart disease, such as mitral valve or aortic valve disease   - Failure of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension caused by lung disease - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as emphysema   - Lung disease such as pulmonary fibrosis, a condition that causes scarring in the tissue between the lungs' air sacs (interstitium)   - Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders   - Long-term exposure to high altitudes in people who may be at higher risk of pulmonary hypertension Group 4: Pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic blood clots - Chronic blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary emboli) Group 5: Pulmonary hypertension associated with other conditions that have unclear reasons why the pulmonary hypertension occurs - Blood disorders   - Disorders that affect several organs in the body, such as sarcoidosis   - Metabolic disorders, such as glycogen storage disease   - Tumors pressing against pulmonary arteries Eisenmenger syndrome and pulmonary hypertension Eisenmenger syndrome, a type of congenital heart disease, causes pulmonary hypertension. It's most commonly caused by a large hole in your heart between the two lower heart chambers (ventricles), called a ventricular septal defect. This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart. Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood). The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension. Your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension may be greater if: - You're a young adult, as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is more common in younger adults   - You're overweight   - You have a family history of the disease   - You have one of various conditions that can increase your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension   - You use illegal drugs, such as cocaine   - You take certain appetite-suppressant medications   - You have an existing risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, such as a family history of the condition, and you live at a high altitude Pulmonary hypertension is hard to diagnose early because it's not often detected in a routine physical exam. Even when the condition is more advanced, its signs and symptoms are similar to those of other heart and lung conditions. To diagnose your condition, your doctor may review your medical and family history, discuss your signs and symptoms, and conduct a physical examination. Doctors may order several tests to diagnose pulmonary hypertension, determine the severity of your condition and find out the cause of your condition. Tests may include: - Echocardiogram. Sound waves can create moving images of the beating heart. An echocardiogram can help your doctor to check the size and functioning of the right ventricle, and the thickness of the right ventricle's wall. An echocardiogram can also show how well your heart chambers and valves are working. Doctors may also use this to measure the pressure in your pulmonary arteries. In some cases, your doctor will recommend an exercise echocardiogram to help determine how well your heart and lungs work under stress. In this test, you'll have an echocardiogram before exercising on a stationary bike or treadmill and another test immediately afterward. This could be done as an oxygen consumption test, in which you may have to wear a mask that assesses the ability of your heart and lungs to deal with oxygen and carbon dioxide. Other exercise tests may also be done. These tests can help determine the severity and cause of your condition. They may also be done at follow-up appointments to check that your treatments are working. - Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show images of your heart, lungs and chest. This test can show enlargement of the right ventricle of the heart or the pulmonary arteries, which can occur in pulmonary hypertension. This test can also be used to identify other conditions that may be causing pulmonary hypertension. - Electrocardiogram (ECG). This noninvasive test shows your heart's electrical patterns and can detect abnormal rhythms. Doctors may also be able to see signs of right ventricle enlargement or strain. - Right heart catheterization. After you've had an echocardiogram, if your doctor thinks you have pulmonary hypertension, you'll likely have a right heart catheterization. This test can often help confirm that you have pulmonary hypertension and determine the severity of your condition. During the procedure, a cardiologist places a thin, flexible tube (catheter) into a vein in your neck or groin. The catheter is then threaded into your right ventricle and pulmonary artery. Right heart catheterization allows your doctor to directly measure the pressure in the main pulmonary arteries and right ventricle. It's also used to see what effect different medications may have on your pulmonary hypertension. - Blood tests. Your doctor might order blood tests to check for certain substances in your blood that might show you have pulmonary hypertension or its complications. Blood tests can also test for certain conditions that may be causing your condition. Your doctor might order additional tests to check the condition of your lungs and pulmonary arteries and to determine the cause of your condition, including: - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. During a CT scan, you lie on a table inside a doughnut-shaped machine. CT scanning generates X-rays to produce cross-sectional images of your body. Doctors may inject a dye into your blood vessels that helps your arteries to be more visible on the CT pictures (CT angiography). Doctors may use this test to look at the heart's size and function and to check for blood clots in the lungs' arteries. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test may be used to check the right ventricle's function and the blood flow in the lung's arteries. In this test, you lie on a movable table that slides into the tunnel. An MRI uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio wave energy to make pictures of the body. - Pulmonary function test. This noninvasive test measures how much air your lungs can hold, and the airflow in and out of your lungs. During the test, you'll blow into a simple instrument called a spirometer. - Polysomnogram. This test detects your brain activity, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels and other factors while you sleep. It can help diagnose a sleep disorder such as obstructive sleep apnea. - Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan. In this test, a tracer is injected into a vein in your arm. The tracer maps blood flow and air to your lungs. This test can be used to determine whether blood clots are causing symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. - Open-lung biopsy. Rarely, a doctor might recommend an open-lung biopsy. An open-lung biopsy is a type of surgery in which a small sample of tissue is removed from your lungs under general anesthesia to check for a possible secondary cause of pulmonary hypertension. Genetic tests If a family member has had pulmonary hypertension, your doctor might screen you for genes that are linked with pulmonary hypertension. If you test positive, your doctor might recommend that other family members be screened for the same genetic mutation. Pulmonary hypertension classifications Once you've been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, your doctor might classify the severity of your disease into one of several classes, including: - Class I. Although you've been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, you have no symptoms with normal activity. - Class II. You don't have symptoms at rest, but you experience symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath or chest pain with normal activity. - Class III. You're comfortable at rest, but have symptoms when you're physically active. - Class IV. You have symptoms with physical activity and while at rest. Pulmonary hypertension can't be cured, but doctors can help you manage your condition. Treatment may help improve your symptoms and slow the progress of pulmonary hypertension. It often takes some time to find the most appropriate treatment for pulmonary hypertension. The treatments are often complex and require extensive follow-up care. Your doctor might also need to change your treatment if it's no longer effective. When pulmonary hypertension is caused by another condition, your doctor will treat the underlying cause whenever possible. Medications - Blood vessel dilators (vasodilators). Vasodilators open narrowed blood vessels. One of the most commonly prescribed vasodilators for pulmonary hypertension is epoprostenol (Flolan, Veletri). The drawback to epoprostenol is that its effects last only a few minutes. This drug is continuously injected through an intravenous (IV) catheter via a small pump that you wear in a pack on your belt or shoulder. Potential side effects of epoprostenol include jaw pain, nausea, diarrhea and leg cramps, as well as pain and infection at the IV site. Another form of the drug, iloprost (Ventavis), can be inhaled six to nine times a day through a nebulizer, a machine that vaporizes your medication. Because it's inhaled, it goes directly to the lungs. Side effects associated with iloprost include chest pain - often accompanied by a headache and nausea - and breathlessness. Treprostinil (Tyvaso, Remodulin, Orenitram), another form of the drug, can be given four times a day. It can be inhaled, taken as oral medication or administered by injection. It can cause side effects such as a headache, nausea and diarrhea. - Endothelin receptor antagonists. These medications reverse the effect of endothelin, a substance in the walls of blood vessels that causes them to narrow. These drugs may improve your energy level and symptoms. However, these drugs shouldn't be taken if you're pregnant. Also, these drugs can damage your liver and you may need monthly liver monitoring. These medications include bosentan (Tracleer), macitentan (Opsumit), and ambrisentan (Letairis). - Sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis, Adcirca) are sometimes used to treat pulmonary hypertension. These drugs work by opening the blood vessels in the lungs to allow blood to flow through more easily. Side effects can include an upset stomach, headache and vision problems. - High-dose calcium channel blockers. These drugs help relax the muscles in the walls of your blood vessels. They include medications such as amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and nifedipine (Procardia, others). Although calcium channel blockers can be effective, only a small number of people with pulmonary hypertension respond to them. - Soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) stimulator. Soluble guanylate cyclase (SGC) stimulators (Adempas) interact with nitric oxide and help relax the pulmonary arteries and lower the pressure within the arteries. These medications should not be taken if you're pregnant. They can sometimes cause dizziness or nausea. - Anticoagulants. Your doctor is likely to prescribe the anticoagulant warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) to help prevent the formation of blood clots within the small pulmonary arteries. Because anticoagulants prevent normal blood coagulation, they increase your risk of bleeding complications. Take warfarin exactly as prescribed, because warfarin can cause severe side effects if taken incorrectly. If you're taking warfarin, your doctor will ask you to have periodic blood tests to check how well the drug is working. Many other drugs, herbal supplements and foods can interact with warfarin, so be sure your doctor knows all of the medications you're taking. - Digoxin. Digoxin (Lanoxin) can help the heart beat stronger and pump more blood. It can help control the heart rate if you experience arrhythmias. - Diuretics. Commonly known as water pills, these medications help eliminate excess fluid from your body. This reduces the amount of work your heart has to do. They may also be used to limit fluid buildup in your lungs. - Oxygen. Your doctor might suggest that you sometimes breathe pure oxygen, a treatment known as oxygen therapy, to help treat pulmonary hypertension, especially if you live at a high altitude or have sleep apnea. Some people who have pulmonary hypertension eventually require continuous oxygen therapy. Surgeries - Atrial septostomy. If medications don't control your pulmonary hypertension, this open-heart surgery might be an option. In an atrial septostomy, a surgeon will create an opening between the upper left and right chambers of your heart (atria) to relieve the pressure on the right side of your heart. Atrial septostomy can have serious complications, including heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias). - Transplantation. In some cases, a lung or heart-lung transplant might be an option, especially for younger people who have idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Major risks of any type of transplantation include rejection of the transplanted organ and serious infection, and you must take immunosuppressant drugs for life to help reduce the chance of rejection. Although medical treatment can't cure pulmonary hypertension, it can lessen symptoms. Lifestyle changes also can help improve your condition. Consider these tips: - Get plenty of rest. Resting can reduce the fatigue that might come from having pulmonary hypertension. - Stay as active as possible. Even the mildest forms of activity might be too exhausting for some people who have pulmonary hypertension. For others, moderate exercise such as walking might be beneficial - especially when done with oxygen. But first, talk to your doctor about specific exercise restrictions. In most cases, it's recommended that you not lift heavy weights. Your doctor can help you plan an appropriate exercise program. - Don't smoke. If you smoke, the most important thing you can do for your heart and lungs is to stop. If you can't stop smoking by yourself, ask your doctor to prescribe a treatment plan to help you quit. Also, avoid secondhand smoke if possible. - Avoid pregnancy and birth control pills. If you're a woman of childbearing age, avoid pregnancy. Pregnancy can be life-threatening for both you and your baby. Also avoid using birth control pills, which can increase your risk of blood clots. Talk to your doctor about alternative forms of birth control. If you do become pregnant, it's important to consult with your doctor as pulmonary hypertension can cause serious complications to both you and the fetus. - Avoid traveling to or living at high altitudes. High altitudes can worsen the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. If you live at an altitude of 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) or higher, your doctor might recommend that you move to a lower altitude. - Avoid situations that can excessively lower blood pressure. These include sitting in a hot tub or sauna or taking long hot baths or showers. These activities lower your blood pressure and can cause fainting or even death. Also avoid activities that cause prolonged straining, such as lifting heavy objects or weights. - Follow a nutritious diet and stay at a healthy weight. Aim to eat a healthy diet of whole grains, a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean meats and low-fat dairy products. Avoid saturated fat, trans fat and cholesterol. It's likely your doctor will recommend limiting the amount of salt in your diet. Aim to maintain a healthy weight. - Ask your doctor about medications. Take all your medications as prescribed. Ask your doctor about any other medications before taking them, as some can interfere with your medication or worsen your condition. - See your doctor at follow-up appointments. Your doctor may recommend regular follow-up appointments. Let your doctor know if you have any questions about your condition or medications you're taking, or if you have any symptoms or side effects from your medications. If pulmonary hypertension is affecting your quality of life, ask your doctor about options that could improve your quality of life. - Get vaccines. Your doctor may recommend getting an influenza and pneumonia vaccine, as these conditions can cause serious issues for people with pulmonary hypertension. - Get support. If you're feeling stressed or worried due to your condition, get support from family or friends. Or, consider joining a support group with others who have pulmonary hypertension."

        "document": "Pulmonary Hypertension (Types): The World Health Organization divides pulmonary hypertension (PH) into five groups. These groups are organized based on the cause of the condition. In all groups, the average pressure in the pulmonary arteries is higher than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity. The pressure in normal pulmonary arteries is 8\u201320 mmHg at rest. (Note that group 1 is called pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and groups 2 through 5 are called pulmonary hypertension. However, together all groups are called pulmonary hypertension.) Group 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Group 1 PAH includes: PAH that has no known cause. PAH that's inherited (passed from parents to children through genes). PAH that's caused by drugs or toxins, such as street drugs and certain diet medicines. PAH that's caused by conditions such as: - Connective tissue diseases. (Connective tissue helps support all parts of your body, including your skin, eyes, and heart.) - HIV infection. - Liver disease. - Congenital heart disease. This is heart disease that's present at birth. - Sickle cell disease. - Schistosomiasis (SKIS-toe-so-MI-ah-sis). This is an infection caused by a parasite. Schistosomiasis is one of the most common causes of PAH in many parts of the world. Connective tissue diseases. (Connective tissue helps support all parts of your body, including your skin, eyes, and heart.) HIV infection. Liver disease. Congenital heart disease. This is heart disease that's present at birth. Sickle cell disease. Schistosomiasis (SKIS-toe-so-MI-ah-sis). This is an infection caused by a parasite. Schistosomiasis is one of the most common causes of PAH in many parts of the world. PAH that's caused by conditions that affect the veins and small blood vessels of the lungs. Group 2 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 2 includes PH with left heart disease. Conditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as mitral valve disease or long-term high blood pressure, can cause left heart disease and PH. Left heart disease is likely the most common cause of PH. Group 3 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 3 includes PH associated with lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial (IN-ter-STISH-al) lung diseases. Interstitial lung diseases cause scarring of the lung tissue. Group 3 also includes PH associated with sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea. Group 4 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 4 includes PH caused by blood clots in the lungs or blood clotting disorders. Group 5 Pulmonary Hypertension Group 5 includes PH caused by various other diseases or conditions. Examples include: Blood disorders, such as polycythemia vera (POL-e-si-THE-me-ah VAY-rah or VE-rah) and essential thrombocythemia (THROM-bo-si-THE-me-ah). Systemic disorders, such as sarcoidosis (sar-koy-DO-sis) and vasculitis (vas-kyu-LI-tis). Systemic disorders involve many of the body's organs. Metabolic disorders, such as thyroid disease and glycogen storage disease. (In glycogen storage disease, the body's cells don't use a form of glucose (sugar) properly.) Other conditions, such as tumors that press on the pulmonary arteries and kidney disease."

If the tests are positive, upper endoscopy is often performed to sample a piece of tissue (biopsy) from the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). The biopsy may show a flattening of the villi in the parts of the intestine below the duodenum.   Genetic testing of the blood can also be done to help determine who may be at risk for celiac disease.   A follow-up biopsy or blood test may be ordered several months after the diagnosis and treatment. These tests assess how well treatment is working.

This reaction can spread outside your digestive tract to other areas of your body, including yourbones joints nervous system skin spleenDepending on how old you are when a doctor diagnoses your celiac disease, some symptoms, such as short height and tooth defects, will not improve.Dermatitis herpetiformis is an itchy, blistering skin rash that usually appears on the elbows, knees, buttocks, back, or scalp. The rash affects about 10 percent of people with celiac disease. The rash can affect people of all ages but is most likely to appear for the first time between the ages of 30 and 40. Men who have the rash also may have oral or, rarely, genital sores. Some people with celiac disease may have the rash and no other symptoms. Symptoms of celiac disease vary from person to person. Your symptoms may depend onhow long you were breastfed as an infant; some studies have shown that the longer you were breastfed, the later celiac disease symptoms appear how much gluten you eat how old you were when you started eating gluten the amount of damage to your small intestine your age\u2014symptoms can vary between young children and adultsPeople with celiac disease who have no symptoms can still develop complications from the disease over time if they do not get treatment. Research suggests that celiac disease only happens to individuals who have particular genes. These genes are common and are carried by about one-third of the population. Individuals also have to be eating food that contains gluten to get celiac disease. Researchers do not know exactly what triggers celiac disease in people at risk who eat gluten over a long period of time. Sometimes the disease runs in families. About 10 to 20 percent of close relatives of people with celiac disease also are affected.3Your chances of developing celiac disease increase when you have changes in your genes, or variants. Certain gene variants and other factors, such as things in your environment, can lead to celiac disease.  Celiac disease can be hard to diagnose because some of the symptoms are like symptoms of other diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and lactose intolerance. Your doctor may diagnose celiac disease with a medical and family history, physical exam, and tests. Tests may include blood tests, genetic tests, and biopsy.Your doctor will ask you for information about your family\u2019s health\u2014specifically, if anyone in your family has a history of celiac disease.During a physical exam, a doctor most oftenchecks your body for a rash or malnutrition, a condition that arises when you don\u2019t get enough vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients you need to be healthy listens to sounds in your abdomen using a stethoscope taps on your abdomen to check for pain and fullness or swellingFor some people, a dental visit can be the first step toward discovering celiac disease. Dental enamel defects, such as white, yellow, or brown spots on the teeth, are a pretty common problem in people with celiac disease, especially children. These defects can help dentists and other health care professionals identify celiac disease.

A health care professional may take a blood sample from you and send the sample to a lab to test for antibodies common in celiac disease. If blood test results are negative and your doctor still suspects celiac disease, he or she may order more blood tests.If a biopsy and other blood tests do not clearly confirm celiac disease, your doctor may order genetic blood tests to check for certain gene changes, or variants.4 You are very unlikely to have celiac disease if these gene variants are not present. Having these variants alone is not enough to diagnose celiac disease because they also are common in people without the disease. In fact, most people with these genes will never get celiac disease.If blood tests suggest you have celiac disease, your doctor will perform a biopsy to be sure. During a biopsy, the doctor takes a small piece of tissue from your small intestine during a procedure called an upper GI endoscopy.If a doctor suspects you have dermatitis herpetiformis, he or she will perform a skin biopsy. For a skin biopsy, the doctor removes tiny pieces of skin tissue to examine with a microscope.A doctor examines the skin tissue and checks the tissue for antibodies common in celiac disease. If the skin tissue has the antibodies, a doctor will perform blood tests to confirm celiac disease. If the skin biopsy and blood tests both suggest celiac disease, you may not need an intestinal biopsy. Screening is testing for diseases when you have no symptoms. Doctors in the United States do not routinely screen people for celiac disease. However, blood relatives of people with celiac disease and those with type 1 diabetes should talk with their doctor about their chances of getting the disease.Many researchers recommend routine screening of all family members, such as parents and siblings, for celiac disease.5 However, routine genetic screening for celiac disease is not usually helpful when diagnosing the disease.  Doctors treat celiac disease with a gluten-free diet. Gluten is a protein found naturally in wheat, barley, and rye that triggers a reaction if you have celiac disease. Symptoms greatly improve for most people with celiac disease who stick to a gluten-free diet. In recent years, grocery stores and restaurants have added many more gluten-free foods and products, making it easier to stay gluten free.Your doctor may refer you to a dietitian who specializes in treating people with celiac disease. The dietitian will teach you how to avoid gluten while following a healthy diet. He or she will help youcheck food and product labels for gluten design everyday meal plans make healthy choices about the types of foods to eatFor most people, following a gluten-free diet will heal damage in the small intestine and prevent more damage. You may see symptoms improve within days to weeks of starting the diet. The small intestine usually heals in 3 to 6 months in children. Complete healing can take several years in adults. Once the intestine heals, the villi, which were damaged by the disease, regrow and will absorb nutrients from food into the bloodstream normally.If you have dermatitis herpetiformis\u2014an itchy, blistering skin rash\u2014skin symptoms generally respond to a gluten-free diet. However, skin symptoms may return if you add gluten back into your diet. Medicines such as dapsone, taken by mouth, can control the skin symptoms. People who take dapsone need to have regular blood tests to check for side effects from the medicine.Dapsone does not treat intestinal symptoms or damage, which is why you should stay on a gluten-free diet if you have the rash. Even when you follow a gluten-free diet, the rash may take months or even years to fully heal\u2014and often comes back over the years. Doctors treat celiac disease with a gluten-free diet.

In addition to prescribing a gluten-free diet, your doctor will want you to avoid all hidden sources of gluten.\u00a0 If you have celiac disease, ask a pharmacist about ingredients inherbal and nutritional supplements prescription and over-the-counter medicines vitamin and mineral supplementsYou also could take in or transfer from your hands to your mouth other products that contain gluten without knowing it. Products that may contain gluten includechildren\u2019s modeling dough, such as Play-Doh cosmetics lipstick, lip gloss, and lip balm skin and hair products toothpaste and mouthwash communion wafersMedications are rare sources of gluten. Even if gluten is present in a medicine, it is likely to be in such small quantities that it would not cause any symptoms.Reading product labels can sometimes help you avoid gluten. Some product makers label their products as being gluten-free. If a product label doesn\u2019t list the product\u2019s ingredients, ask the maker of the product for an ingredients list. If you don\u2019t improve after starting a gluten-free diet, you may still be eating or using small amounts of gluten. You probably will start responding to the gluten-free diet once you find and cut out all hidden sources of gluten. Hidden sources of gluten include additives made with wheat, such asmodified food starch malt flavoring preservatives stabilizersIf you still have symptoms even after changing your diet, you may have other conditions or disorders that are more common with celiac disease, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), lactose intolerance, microscopic colitis, dysfunction of the pancreas, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Avoiding foods with gluten, a protein found naturally in wheat, rye, and barley, is critical in treating celiac disease. Removing gluten from your diet will improve symptoms, heal damage to your small intestine, and prevent further damage over time. While you may need to avoid certain foods, the good news is that many healthy, gluten-free foods and products are available.You should avoid all products that contain gluten, such as most cereal, grains, and pasta, and many processed foods. Be sure to always read food ingredient lists carefully to make sure the food you want to eat doesn\u2019t have gluten.

In addition, discuss gluten-free food choices with a dietitian or health care professional who specializes in celiac disease. Foods such as meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, rice, and potatoes without additives or seasonings do not contain gluten and are part of a well-balanced diet. You can eat gluten-free types of bread, pasta, and other foods that are now easier to find in stores, restaurants, and at special food companies. You also can eat potato, rice, soy, amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat, or bean flour instead of wheat flour.In the past, doctors and dietitians advised against eating oats if you have celiac disease. Evidence suggests that most people with the disease can safely eat moderate amounts of oats, as long as they did not come in contact with wheat gluten during processing. You should talk with your health care team about whether to include oats in your diet.When shopping and eating out, remember toread food labels\u2014especially on canned, frozen, and processed foods\u2014for ingredients that contain gluten identify foods labelled \u201cgluten-free;\u201d by law, these foods must contain less than 20 parts per million, well below the threshold to cause problems in the great majority of patients with celiac disease ask restaurant servers and chefs about how they prepare the food and what is in it find out whether a gluten-free menu is available ask a dinner or party host about gluten-free options before attending a social gatheringFoods labeled gluten-free tend to cost more than the same foods that have gluten. You may find that naturally gluten-free foods are less expensive. With practice, looking for gluten can become second nature.If you have just been diagnosed with celiac disease, you and your family members may find support groups helpful as you adjust to a new approach to eating. In recent years, more people without celiac disease have adopted a gluten-free diet, believing that avoiding gluten is healthier or could help them lose weight. No current data suggests that the general public should maintain a gluten-free diet for weight loss or better health. 6, 7A gluten-free diet isn\u2019t always a healthy diet. For instance, a gluten-free diet may not provide enough of the nutrients, vitamins, and minerals the body needs, such as fiber, iron, and calcium. Some gluten-free products can be high in calories and sugar.If you think you might have celiac disease, don\u2019t start avoiding gluten without first speaking with your doctor. If your doctor diagnoses you with celiac disease, he or she will put you on a gluten-free diet. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a rule defining what \u201cgluten-free\u201d means on food labels. The \"gluten-free\" for food labeling rule requires that any food with the terms \u201cgluten-free,\u201d \u201cno gluten,\u201d \"free of gluten,\u201d and \u201cwithout gluten\u201d on the label must meet all of the definition\u2019s requirements.While the FDA rule does not apply to foods regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, including meat and egg products, it is often still observed."

        "query": "what blood tests confirm celiac disease",
        "document": "Celiac disease: Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy), sometimes called sprue or coeliac, is an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response in your small intestine. Over time, this reaction damages your small intestine's lining and prevents absorption of some nutrients (malabsorption). The intestinal damage often causes diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating and anemia, and can lead to serious complications. In children, malabsorption can affect growth and development, in addition to the symptoms seen in adults. There's no cure for celiac disease - but for most people, following a strict gluten-free diet can help manage symptoms and promote intestinal healing. The signs and symptoms of celiac disease can vary greatly and are different in children and adults. The most common signs for adults are diarrhea, fatigue and weight loss. Adults may also experience bloating and gas, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, and vomiting. However, more than half of adults with celiac disease have signs and symptoms that are not related to the digestive system, including: - Anemia, usually resulting from iron deficiency   - Loss of bone density (osteoporosis) or softening of bone (osteomalacia)   - Itchy, blistery skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis)   - Damage to dental enamel   - Mouth ulcers   - Headaches and fatigue   - Nervous system injury, including numbness and tingling in the feet and hands, possible problems with balance, and cognitive impairment   - Joint pain   - Reduced functioning of the spleen (hyposplenism)   - Acid reflux and heartburn In children under 2 years old, typical signs and symptoms of celiac disease include: - Vomiting   - Chronic diarrhea   - Swollen belly   - Failure to thrive   - Poor appetite   - Muscle wasting Older children may experience: - Diarrhea   - Constipation   - Weight loss   - Irritability   - Short stature   - Delayed puberty   - Neurological symptoms, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disabilities, headaches, lack of muscle coordination and seizures Dermatitis herpetiformis is an itchy, blistering skin disease that stems from intestinal gluten intolerance. The rash usually occurs on the elbows, knees, torso, scalp and buttocks. Dermatitis herpetiformis is often associated with changes to the lining of the small intestine identical to those of celiac disease, but the disease may not produce noticeable digestive symptoms. Doctors treat dermatitis herpetiformis with a gluten-free diet or medication, or both, to control the rash. Consult your doctor if you have diarrhea or digestive discomfort that lasts for more than two weeks. Consult your child's doctor if your child is pale, irritable or failing to grow or has a potbelly and foul-smelling, bulky stools. Be sure to consult your doctor before trying a gluten-free diet. If you stop or even reduce the amount of gluten you eat before you're tested for celiac disease, you may change the test results. Celiac disease tends to run in families. If someone in your family has the condition, ask your doctor if you should be tested. Also ask your doctor about testing if you or someone in your family has a risk factor for celiac disease, such as type 1 diabetes. Celiac disease occurs from an interaction between genes, eating foods with gluten and other environmental factors, but the precise cause isn't known. Infant feeding practices, gastrointestinal infections and gut bacteria might contribute to developing celiac disease. Sometimes celiac disease is triggered - or becomes active for the first time - after surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, viral infection or severe emotional stress. When the body's immune system overreacts to gluten in food, the reaction damages the tiny, hair-like projections (villi) that line the small intestine. Villi absorb vitamins, minerals and other nutrients from the food you eat. If your villi are damaged, you can't get enough nutrients, no matter how much you eat. Some gene variations appear to increase the risk of developing the disease. But having those gene variants doesn't mean you'll get celiac disease, which suggests that additional factors must be involved. The rate of celiac disease in Western countries is estimated at about 1 percent of the population. Celiac disease is most common in Caucasians; however, it is now being diagnosed among many ethnic groups and is being found globally. Celiac disease can affect anyone. However, it tends to be more common in people who have: - A family member with celiac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis   - Type 1 diabetes   - Down syndrome or Turner syndrome   - Autoimmune thyroid disease   - Microscopic colitis (lymphocytic or collagenous colitis)   - Addison's disease   - Rheumatoid arthritis Researchers estimate that only 20 percent of people with celiac disease may receive a diagnosis. Doctors may order two blood tests to help diagnose celiac disease. - Serology testing looks for antibodies in your blood. Elevated levels of certain antibody proteins indicate an immune reaction to gluten. - Genetic testing for human leukocyte antigens (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8) can be used to rule out celiac disease. If the results of these tests indicate celiac disease, your doctor may order an endoscopy to view your small intestine and to take a small tissue sample (biopsy) to analyze for damage to the villi. It's important to be tested for celiac disease before trying a gluten-free diet. Eliminating gluten from your diet may change the results of blood tests so that they appear to be normal. A strict, lifelong gluten-free diet is the only way to manage celiac disease. In addition to wheat, foods that contain gluten include: - Barley - Bulgur - Durum - Farina - Graham flour - Malt - Rye - Semolina - Spelt (a form of wheat) - Triticale Your doctor may refer you to a dietitian, who can help you plan a healthy gluten-free diet. Once you remove gluten from your diet, inflammation in your small intestine generally begins to lessen - usually within several weeks, though you may start to feel better in just a few days. Complete healing and regrowth of the villi may take several months to several years. Healing in the small intestine tends to occur more quickly in children than adults. If you accidentally eat a product that contains gluten, you may experience abdominal pain and diarrhea. Some people experience no signs or symptoms after eating gluten, but this doesn't mean it's not harmful to them. Even trace amounts of gluten in your diet can be damaging, whether or not they cause signs or symptoms. Hidden gluten can be present in foods, medications and nonfood products, including: - Modified food starch, preservatives and food stabilizers - Prescription and over-the-counter medications - Vitamin and mineral supplements - Herbal and nutritional supplements - Lipstick products - Toothpaste and mouthwash - Envelope and stamp glue - Play-Doh Vitamin and mineral supplements If your nutritional deficiencies are severe, your doctor or dietitian may recommend taking vitamin and mineral supplements. You may need to supplement your levels of: - Calcium - Folate - Iron - Vitamin B-12 - Vitamin D - Vitamin K - Zinc Vitamins and supplements are usually taken in pill form. If your digestive tract has trouble absorbing vitamins, your doctor may give them by injection. You need to be sure that the vitamins and supplements are gluten-free. Follow-up care If you have celiac disease, you will need medical follow-up to make sure your symptoms have responded to a gluten-free diet. Doctors will also want to be sure you are getting the support you need to maintain the diet for life. They will use blood tests to monitor your response. The results of these tests, which are primarily designed as a way to detect celiac disease, usually become negative once you have been gluten-free for six to 12 months. If test results remain positive, then your doctor may try to find the reason, the most common being unintentional exposure to gluten in your diet. However, these tests are not perfect, and even if the results become negative, it is possible that you could still be exposed to a significant amount of gluten and continue to have symptoms and damage to your intestines. If you continue to have symptoms, or your symptoms recur, you may need a follow-up endoscopy with biopsies to ensure that healing has occurred. Adults typically have a greater need for follow-up testing, although children may require it, too. Some doctors recommend a routine re-biopsy if you are diagnosed in adulthood, as healing is often quite slow and uncertain. It also can be helpful to follow up with an expert dietitian for assistance in adapting to, and maintaining, a healthy, nutritious, gluten-free diet. Medications to control intestinal inflammation If your small intestine is severely damaged, your doctor may recommend steroids to control inflammation. Steroids can ease severe signs and symptoms of celiac disease while the intestine heals. Dermatitis herpetiformis If you have this itchy, blistering skin rash that sometimes accompanies celiac disease, your doctor may recommend a skin medication (dapsone) along with the gluten-free diet. Refractory celiac disease If you have refractory celiac disease, you may continue to have severe symptoms, or your symptoms may lessen but then relapse. In either case, your small intestine does not heal. When this happens, you likely will require evaluation in a specialized center. Refractory celiac disease can be quite serious and there is currently no proven treatment. People with refractory celiac disease should be treated by experts. There may be several causes for this condition. Doctors will often use steroid therapy - either a topical budesonide or systemic steroids such as prednisone. Sometimes, they will use the same medications used to treat other conditions. Potential future treatments While the only proven therapy for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet, it is not perfect. People with celiac disease may often be accidentally exposed to gluten, possibly causing severe symptoms. Several treatments are in development for celiac disease. Some try to neutralize or bind to gluten. Others address the barrier of the intestine, blocking the leakiness that gluten can trigger. Still others target the body's immune system. Researchers have also been trying to genetically modify wheat, but have not yet been successful. None of these treatments is likely to be approved within the next two to three years. However, given the number of different approaches, there is a good chance that there will be additional treatments available for celiac disease in the future. If you've been diagnosed with celiac disease, you'll need to avoid all foods that contain gluten. Ask your doctor for a referral to a dietitian, who can help you plan a healthy gluten-free diet. It's important to get enough vitamins, nutrients, fiber and calcium in your diet. Here's an overview of foods that contain gluten and gluten-free foods that are safe to eat. Avoid food and drinks containing: - Barley - Bulgur - Durum - Farina - Graham flour - Malt - Rye - Semolina - Spelt (a form of wheat) - Triticale - Wheat Packaged foods should be avoided unless they're labeled as gluten-free or have no gluten-containing ingredients. In addition to cereals, pastas and baked goods - such as breads, cakes, pies and cookies - other packaged foods that may contain gluten include: - Beer - Candies - Gravies - Imitation meats or seafood - Processed luncheon meats - Salad dressings and sauces, including soy sauce - Self-basting poultry - Soups Certain grains, such as oats, can be contaminated with wheat during growing and processing. Pure oats are not harmful for most people with celiac disease. In the United States, doctors generally recommend avoiding oats unless they have been specifically labeled gluten-free. Outside of the United States, different labeling laws for oats apply. Occasionally, even pure oats can be a problem for people with celiac disease. Many basic foods are allowed in a gluten-free diet, including: - Fresh meats, fish and poultry that aren't breaded, batter-coated or marinated - Fruits - Most dairy products - Potatoes - Vegetables - Wine and distilled liquors, ciders and spirits Grains and starches allowed in a gluten-free diet include: - Amaranth - Arrowroot - Buckwheat - Corn - Cornmeal - Gluten-free flours (rice, soy, corn, potato, bean) - Pure corn tortillas - Quinoa - Rice - Tapioca Carob is a potential substitute for gluten, but more research is needed about its effect on people with celiac disease. Fortunately for bread and pasta lovers with celiac disease, an increasing number of gluten-free products are available. If you can't find any at your local bakery or grocery store, check online. There are gluten-free substitutes for many gluten-containing foods. However, be aware that processed gluten-free foods may contain excessive fat and calories. There are no proven treatments that assist with celiac disease. Enzyme therapies that claim to digest gluten may be available in health food stores or other outlets, but there is no scientific evidence that they are effective in treating celiac disease."

        "query": "what can cause hypoglycemia",
        "document": "Hypoglycemia (Causes): Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) level falls too low. There are several reasons why this may happen, the most common is a side effect of drugs used to treat diabetes. Blood sugar regulation But to understand how hypoglycemia happens, it helps to know how your body normally processes blood sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down carbohydrates from foods - such as bread, rice, pasta, vegetables, fruit and milk products - into various sugar molecules, including glucose. Glucose is the main energy source for your body, but it can't enter the cells of most of your tissues without the help of insulin - a hormone secreted by your pancreas. When glucose levels rise, certain cells (beta cells) in your pancreas release insulin. This allows glucose to enter the cells and provide the fuel your cells need to function properly. Any extra glucose is stored in your liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. If you haven't eaten for several hours and your blood sugar level drops, another hormone from your pancreas called glucagon signals your liver to break down the stored glycogen and release glucose back into your bloodstream. This keeps your blood sugar level within a normal range until you eat again. Aside from your liver breaking down glycogen into glucose, your body also has the ability to manufacture glucose. This process occurs primarily in your liver, but also in your kidneys. Possible causes, with diabetes People with diabetes may not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or may be less responsive to it (type 2 diabetes). As a result, glucose tends to build up in the bloodstream and may reach dangerously high levels. To correct this problem, someone with diabetes may take insulin or other drugs to lower blood sugar levels. But too much insulin or other diabetes medications may cause your blood sugar level to drop too low, causing hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia may also happen if you don't eat as much food as usual after taking diabetes medication, or if you exercise more than you normally would. Possible causes, without diabetes Hypoglycemia in people without diabetes is much less common. Causes may include the following: - Medications. Taking someone else's oral diabetes medication accidentally is a possible cause of hypoglycemia. Other medications may cause hypoglycemia, especially in children or in people with kidney failure. One example is quinine (Qualaquin), which is used to treat malaria.   - Excessive alcohol consumption. Drinking heavily without eating can block your liver from releasing stored glucose into your bloodstream, causing hypoglycemia.   - Some critical illnesses. Severe illnesses of the liver, such as severe hepatitis, can cause hypoglycemia. Disorders of the kidney, which can keep your body from properly excreting medications, can affect glucose levels due to a buildup of those medications. Long-term starvation, as may occur in the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, can result in the depletion of substances your body needs to generate glucose (gluconeogenesis), causing hypoglycemia.   - Insulin overproduction. A rare tumor of the pancreas (insulinoma) may cause overproduction of insulin, resulting in hypoglycemia. Other tumors may result in excessive production of insulin-like substances. Enlargement of beta cells of the pancreas that produce insulin (nesidioblastosis) may result in excessive insulin release, causing hypoglycemia.   - Hormone deficiencies. Certain disorders of the adrenal glands and the pituitary gland can result in a deficiency of key hormones that regulate glucose production. Children may experience hypoglycemia if they have a deficiency of growth hormone. Hypoglycemia after meals Hypoglycemia usually occurs when you haven't eaten (when you're in a fasting state), but that's not always the case. Sometimes hypoglycemia occurs after meals because the body produces more insulin than is needed. This type of hypoglycemia, called reactive or postprandial hypoglycemia, may occur in people who have had stomach surgery. It may also occur in people who haven't had this surgery."

Repeated episodes of low blood sugar increase the risk for serious complications such as breathing difficulties, seizures, intellectual disability, vision loss, brain damage, and coma.   The severity of congenital hyperinsulinism varies widely among affected individuals, even among members of the same family. About 60 percent of infants with this condition experience a hypoglycemic episode within the first month of life. Other affected children develop hypoglycemia by early childhood. Unlike typical episodes of hypoglycemia, which occur most often after periods without food (fasting) or after exercising, episodes of hypoglycemia in people with congenital hyperinsulinism can also occur after eating."

        "query": "what causes bipolar disorder",
        "document": "Bipolar disorder: Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly. Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any. Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy). Bipolar disorder care at Mayo Clinic There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life. - Bipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis).   - Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode.   - Cyclothymic disorder. You've had at least two years - or one year in children and teenagers - of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression).   - Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke. Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment. Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization. Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms: - Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired   - Increased activity, energy or agitation   - Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria)   - Decreased need for sleep   - Unusual talkativeness   - Racing thoughts   - Distractibility   - Poor decision-making - for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments Major depressive episode A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms: - Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability)   - Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all - or almost all - activities   - Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression)   - Either insomnia or sleeping too much   - Either restlessness or slowed behavior   - Fatigue or loss of energy   - Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt   - Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness   - Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide Other features of bipolar disorder Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons. Symptoms in children and teens Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It's often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. The most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings. When to see a doctor Despite the mood extremes, people with bipolar disorder often don't recognize how much their emotional instability disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones and don't get the treatment they need. And if you're like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. However, this euphoria is always followed by an emotional crash that can leave you depressed, worn out - and perhaps in financial, legal or relationship trouble. If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your doctor or mental health professional. Bipolar disorder doesn't get better on its own. Getting treatment from a mental health professional with experience in bipolar disorder can help you get your symptoms under control. When to get emergency help Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with bipolar disorder. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or call a suicide hotline number - in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room. The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors may be involved, such as: - Biological differences. People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes.   - Genetics. Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing bipolar disorder. Factors that may increase the risk of developing bipolar disorder or act as a trigger for the first episode include: - Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with bipolar disorder   - Periods of high stress, such as the death of a loved one or other traumatic event   - Drug or alcohol abuse Left untreated, bipolar disorder can result in serious problems that affect every area of your life, such as: - Problems related to drug and alcohol use   - Suicide or suicide attempts   - Legal or financial problems   - Damaged relationships   - Poor work or school performance Co-occurring conditions If you have bipolar disorder, you may also have another health condition that needs to be treated along with bipolar disorder. Some conditions can worsen bipolar disorder symptoms or make treatment less successful. Examples include: - Anxiety disorders   - Eating disorders   - Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)   - Alcohol or drug problems   - Physical health problems, such as heart disease, thyroid problems, headaches or obesity To determine if you have bipolar disorder, your evaluation may include: - Physical exam. Your doctor may do a physical exam and lab tests to identify any medical problems that could be causing your symptoms. - Psychiatric assessment. Your doctor may refer you to a psychiatrist, who will talk to you about your thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may also fill out a psychological self-assessment or questionnaire. With your permission, family members or close friends may be asked to provide information about your symptoms. - Mood charting. You may be asked to keep a daily record of your moods, sleep patterns or other factors that could help with diagnosis and finding the right treatment. - Criteria for bipolar disorder. Your psychiatrist may compare your symptoms with the criteria for bipolar and related disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Diagnosis in children Although diagnosis of children and teenagers with bipolar disorder includes the same criteria that are used for adults, symptoms in children and teens often have different patterns and may not fit neatly into the diagnostic categories. Also, children who have bipolar disorder are frequently also diagnosed with other mental health conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or behavior problems, which can make diagnosis more complicated. Referral to a child psychiatrist with experience in bipolar disorder is recommended. Treatment is best guided by a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions (psychiatrist) who is skilled in treating bipolar and related disorders. You may have a treatment team that also includes a psychologist, social worker and psychiatric nurse. Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition. Treatment is directed at managing symptoms. Depending on your needs, treatment may include: - Medications. Often, you'll need to start taking medications to balance your moods right away. - Continued treatment. Bipolar disorder requires lifelong treatment with medications, even during periods when you feel better. People who skip maintenance treatment are at high risk of a relapse of symptoms or having minor mood changes turn into full-blown mania or depression. - Day treatment programs. Your doctor may recommend a day treatment program. These programs provide the support and counseling you need while you get symptoms under control. - Substance abuse treatment. If you have problems with alcohol or drugs, you'll also need substance abuse treatment. Otherwise, it can be very difficult to manage bipolar disorder. - Hospitalization. Your doctor may recommend hospitalization if you're behaving dangerously, you feel suicidal or you become detached from reality (psychotic). Getting psychiatric treatment at a hospital can help keep you calm and safe and stabilize your mood, whether you're having a manic or major depressive episode. The primary treatments for bipolar disorder include medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy) to control symptoms, and also may include education and support groups. Medications A number of medications are used to treat bipolar disorder. The types and doses of medications prescribed are based on your particular symptoms. Medications may include: - Mood stabilizers. You'll typically need mood-stabilizing medication to control manic or hypomanic episodes. Examples of mood stabilizers include lithium (Lithobid), valproic acid (Depakene), divalproex sodium (Depakote), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Equetro, others) and lamotrigine (Lamictal). - Antipsychotics. If symptoms of depression or mania persist in spite of treatment with other medications, adding an antipsychotic drug such as olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal), quetiapine (Seroquel), aripiprazole (Abilify), ziprasidone (Geodon), lurasidone (Latuda) or asenapine (Saphris) may help. Your doctor may prescribe some of these medications alone or along with a mood stabilizer. - Antidepressants. Your doctor may add an antidepressant to help manage depression. Because an antidepressant can sometimes trigger a manic episode, it's usually prescribed along with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. - Antidepressant-antipsychotic. The medication Symbyax combines the antidepressant fluoxetine and the antipsychotic olanzapine. It works as a depression treatment and a mood stabilizer. - Anti-anxiety medications. Benzodiazepines may help with anxiety and improve sleep, but are usually used on a short-term basis. Finding the right medication Finding the right medication or medications for you will likely take some trial and error. If one doesn't work well for you, there are several others to try. This process requires patience, as some medications need weeks to months to take full effect. Generally only one medication is changed at a time so that your doctor can identify which medications work to relieve your symptoms with the least bothersome side effects. Medications also may need to be adjusted as your symptoms change. Side effects Mild side effects often improve as you find the right medications and doses that work for you, and your body adjusts to the medications. Talk to your doctor or mental health professional if you have bothersome side effects. Don't make changes or stop taking your medications. If you stop your medication, you may experience withdrawal effects or your symptoms may worsen or return. You may become very depressed, feel suicidal, or go into a manic or hypomanic episode. If you think you need to make a change, call your doctor. Medications and pregnancy A number of medications for bipolar disorder can be associated with birth defects and can pass through breast milk to your baby. Certain medications, such as valproic acid and divalproex sodium, should not be used during pregnancy. Also, birth control medications may lose effectiveness when taken along with certain bipolar disorder medications. Discuss treatment options with your doctor before you become pregnant, if possible. If you're taking medication to treat your bipolar disorder and think you may be pregnant, talk to your doctor right away. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy is a vital part of bipolar disorder treatment and can be provided in individual, family or group settings. Several types of therapy may be helpful. These include: - Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT). IPSRT focuses on the stabilization of daily rhythms, such as sleeping, waking and mealtimes. A consistent routine allows for better mood management. People with bipolar disorder may benefit from establishing a daily routine for sleep, diet and exercise. - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The focus is identifying unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and replacing them with healthy, positive ones. CBT can help identify what triggers your bipolar episodes. You also learn effective strategies to manage stress and to cope with upsetting situations. - Psychoeducation. Learning about bipolar disorder (psychoeducation) can help you and your loved ones understand the condition. Knowing what's going on can help you get the best support, identify issues, make a plan to prevent relapse and stick with treatment. - Family-focused therapy. Family support and communication can help you stick with your treatment plan and help you and your loved ones recognize and manage warning signs of mood swings. Other treatment options Depending on your needs, other treatments may be added to your depression therapy. During electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), electrical currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure. ECT seems to cause changes in brain chemistry that can reverse symptoms of certain mental illnesses. ECT may be an option for bipolar treatment if you don't get better with medications, can't take antidepressants for health reasons such as pregnancy or are at high risk of suicide. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is being investigated as an option for those who haven't responded to antidepressants. Treatment in children and teenagers Treatments for children and teenagers are generally decided on a case-by-case basis, depending on symptoms, medication side effects and other factors. Generally, treatment includes: - Medications. Children and teens with bipolar disorder are often prescribed the same types of medications as those used in adults. There's less research on the safety and effectiveness of bipolar medications in children than in adults, so treatment decisions are often based on adult research. - Psychotherapy. Initial and long-term therapy can help keep symptoms from returning. Psychotherapy can help children and teens manage their routines, develop coping skills, address learning difficulties, resolve social problems, and help strengthen family bonds and communication. And, if needed, it can help treat substance abuse problems common in older children and teens with bipolar disorder. - Psychoeducation. Psychoeducation can include learning the symptoms of bipolar disorder and how they differ from behavior related to your child's developmental age, the situation and appropriate cultural behavior. Understanding about bipolar disorder can also help you support your child. - Support. Working with teachers and school counselors and encouraging support from family and friends can help identify services and encourage success. You'll probably need to make lifestyle changes to stop cycles of behavior that worsen your bipolar disorder. Here are some steps to take: - Quit drinking or using recreational drugs. One of the biggest concerns with bipolar disorder is the negative consequences of risk-taking behavior and drug or alcohol abuse. Get help if you have trouble quitting on your own. - Form healthy relationships. Surround yourself with people who are a positive influence. Friends and family members can provide support and help you watch for warning signs of mood shifts. - Create a healthy routine. Having a regular routine for sleeping, eating and physical activity can help balance your moods. Check with your doctor before starting any exercise program. Eat a healthy diet. If you take lithium, talk with your doctor about appropriate fluid and salt intake. If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor or mental health professional about what you can do. - Check first before taking other medications. Call the doctor who's treating you for bipolar disorder before you take medications prescribed by another doctor or any over-the-counter supplements or medications. Sometimes other medications trigger episodes of depression or mania or may interfere with medications you're taking for bipolar disorder. - Consider keeping a mood chart. Keeping a record of your daily moods, treatments, sleep, activities and feelings may help identify triggers, effective treatment options and when treatment needs to be adjusted. There isn't much research on alternative or complementary medicine - sometimes called integrative medicine - and bipolar disorder. Most of the studies are on major depression, so it isn't clear how these nontraditional approaches work for bipolar disorder. If you choose to use alternative or complementary medicine in addition to your physician-recommended treatment, take some precautions first: - Don't stop taking your prescribed medications or skip therapy sessions. Alternative or complementary medicine is not a substitute for regular medical care when it comes to treating bipolar disorder. - Be honest with your doctors and mental health professionals. Tell them exactly which alternative or complementary treatments you use or would like to try. - Be aware of potential dangers. Alternative and complementary products aren't regulated the way prescription drugs are. Just because it's natural doesn't mean it's safe. Before using alternative or complementary medicine, talk to your doctor about the risks, including possible serious interactions with medications."

        "query": "what does kidney disease look like",
        "document": "Chronic kidney disease: Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body. In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired. Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of the kidney damage, usually by controlling the underlying cause. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant. Chronic kidney disease care at Mayo Clinic Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly. Signs and symptoms of kidney disease may include: - Nausea   - Vomiting   - Loss of appetite   - Fatigue and weakness   - Sleep problems   - Changes in how much you urinate   - Decreased mental sharpness   - Muscle twitches and cramps   - Swelling of feet and ankles   - Persistent itching   - Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart   - Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs   - High blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific, meaning they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys are highly adaptable and able to compensate for lost function, signs and symptoms may not appear until irreversible damage has occurred. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms of kidney disease. If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your doctor is likely to monitor your blood pressure and kidney function with urine and blood tests during regular office visits. Ask your doctor whether these tests are necessary for you. Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years. Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include: - Type 1 or type 2 diabetes   - High blood pressure   - Glomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's filtering units (glomeruli)   - Interstitial nephritis (in-tur-STISH-ul nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the kidney's tubules and surrounding structures   - Polycystic kidney disease   - Prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract, from conditions such as enlarged prostate, kidney stones and some cancers   - Vesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux, a condition that causes urine to back up into your kidneys   - Recurrent kidney infection, also called pyelonephritis (pie-uh-low-nuh-FRY-tis) Factors that may increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include: - Diabetes   - High blood pressure   - Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease   - Smoking   - Obesity   - Being African-American, Native American or Asian-American   - Family history of kidney disease   - Abnormal kidney structure   - Older age Chronic kidney disease can affect almost every part of your body. Potential complications may include: - Fluid retention, which could lead to swelling in your arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema)   - A sudden rise in potassium levels in your blood (hyperkalemia), which could impair your heart's ability to function and may be life-threatening   - Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease   - Weak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures   - Anemia   - Decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility   - Damage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures   - Decreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection   - Pericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart (pericardium)   - Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus   - Irreversible damage to your kidneys (end-stage kidney disease), eventually requiring either dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival As a first step toward diagnosis of kidney disease, your doctor discusses your personal and family history with you. Among other things, your doctor might ask questions about whether you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, if you've taken a medication that might affect kidney function, if you've noticed changes in your urinary habits, and whether you have any family members who have kidney disease. Next, your doctor performs a physical exam, also checking for signs of problems with your heart or blood vessels, and conducts a neurological exam. For kidney disease diagnosis, you may also need certain tests and procedures, such as: - Blood tests. Kidney function tests look for the level of waste products, such as creatinine and urea, in your blood. - Urine tests. Analyzing a sample of your urine may reveal abnormalities that point to chronic kidney failure and help identify the cause of chronic kidney disease. - Imaging tests. Your doctor may use ultrasound to assess your kidneys' structure and size. Other imaging tests may be used in some cases. - Removing a sample of kidney tissue for testing. Your doctor may recommend a kidney biopsy to remove a sample of kidney tissue. Kidney biopsy is often done with local anesthesia using a long, thin needle that's inserted through your skin and into your kidney. The biopsy sample is sent to a lab for testing to help determine what's causing your kidney problem. Depending on the underlying cause, some types of kidney disease can be treated. Often, though, chronic kidney disease has no cure. Treatment usually consists of measures to help control signs and symptoms, reduce complications, and slow progression of the disease. If your kidneys become severely damaged, you may need treatment for end-stage kidney disease. Treating the cause Your doctor will work to slow or control the cause of your kidney disease. Treatment options vary, depending on the cause. But kidney damage can continue to worsen even when an underlying condition, such as high blood pressure, has been controlled. Treating complications Kidney disease complications can be controlled to make you more comfortable. Treatments may include: - High blood pressure medications. People with kidney disease may experience worsening high blood pressure. Your doctor may recommend medications to lower your blood pressure - commonly angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers - and to preserve kidney function. High blood pressure medications can initially decrease kidney function and change electrolyte levels, so you may need frequent blood tests to monitor your condition. Your doctor will likely also recommend a water pill (diuretic) and a low-salt diet. - Medications to lower cholesterol levels. Your doctor may recommend medications called statins to lower your cholesterol. People with chronic kidney disease often experience high levels of bad cholesterol, which can increase the risk of heart disease. - Medications to treat anemia. In certain situations, your doctor may recommend supplements of the hormone erythropoietin (uh-rith-roe-POI-uh-tin), sometimes with added iron. Erythropoietin supplements aid in production of more red blood cells, which may relieve fatigue and weakness associated with anemia. - Medications to relieve swelling. People with chronic kidney disease may retain fluids. This can lead to swelling in the legs, as well as high blood pressure. Medications called diuretics can help maintain the balance of fluids in your body. - Medications to protect your bones. Your doctor may prescribe calcium and vitamin D supplements to prevent weak bones and lower your risk of fracture. You may also take medication known as a phosphate binder to lower the amount of phosphate in your blood, and protect your blood vessels from damage by calcium deposits (calcification). - A lower protein diet to minimize waste products in your blood. As your body processes protein from foods, it creates waste products that your kidneys must filter from your blood. To reduce the amount of work your kidneys must do, your doctor may recommend eating less protein. Your doctor may also ask you to meet with a dietitian who can suggest ways to lower your protein intake while still eating a healthy diet. Your doctor may recommend follow-up testing at regular intervals to see whether your kidney disease remains stable or progresses. Treatment for end-stage kidney disease If your kidneys can't keep up with waste and fluid clearance on their own and you develop complete or near-complete kidney failure, you have end-stage kidney disease. At that point, you need dialysis or a kidney transplant. - Dialysis. Dialysis artificially removes waste products and extra fluid from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do this. In hemodialysis, a machine filters waste and excess fluids from your blood. In peritoneal dialysis, a thin tube (catheter) inserted into your abdomen fills your abdominal cavity with a dialysis solution that absorbs waste and excess fluids. After a period of time, the dialysis solution drains from your body, carrying the waste with it. - Kidney transplant. A kidney transplant involves surgically placing a healthy kidney from a donor into your body. Transplanted kidneys can come from deceased or living donors. You'll need to take medications for the rest of your life to keep your body from rejecting the new organ. You don't need to be on dialysis to have a kidney transplant. For some who choose not to have dialysis or a kidney transplant, a third option is to treat kidney failure with conservative measures. However, once you have complete kidney failure, your life expectancy generally would be only a few months. Potential future treatments Regenerative medicine holds the potential to fully heal damaged tissues and organs, offering solutions and hope for people who have conditions that today are beyond repair. Regenerative medicine approaches include: - Boosting the body's natural ability to heal itself - Using healthy cells, tissues or organs from a living or deceased donor to replace damaged ones - Delivering specific types of cells or cell products to diseased tissues or organs to restore tissue and organ function For people with chronic kidney disease, regenerative medicine approaches may be developed in the future to help slow progression of the disease. As part of your treatment for chronic kidney disease, your doctor may recommend a special diet to help support your kidneys and limit the work they must do. Ask your doctor for a referral to a dietitian who can analyze your current diet and suggest ways to make your diet easier on your kidneys. Depending on your situation, kidney function and overall health, your dietitian may recommend that you: - Avoid products with added salt. Lower the amount of sodium you eat each day by avoiding products with added salt, including many convenience foods, such as frozen dinners, canned soups and fast foods. Other foods with added salt include salty snack foods, canned vegetables, and processed meats and cheeses. - Choose lower potassium foods. Your dietitian may recommend that you choose lower potassium foods at each meal. High-potassium foods include bananas, oranges, potatoes, spinach and tomatoes. Examples of low-potassium foods include apples, cabbage, carrots, green beans, grapes and strawberries. Be aware that many salt substitutes contain potassium, so you generally should avoid them if you have kidney failure. - Limit the amount of protein you eat. Your dietitian will estimate the appropriate number of grams of protein you need each day and make recommendations based on that amount. High-protein foods include lean meats, eggs, milk, cheese and beans. Low-protein foods include vegetables, fruits, breads and cereals."

        "document": "Polycystic kidney disease: Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is an inherited disorder in which clusters of cysts develop primarily within your kidneys, causing your kidneys to enlarge and lose function over time. Cysts are noncancerous round sacs containing fluid. The cysts vary in size, and they can grow very large. Having many cysts or large cysts can damage your kidneys. Polycystic kidney disease also can cause cysts to develop in your liver and elsewhere in your body. The disease can cause serious complications, including high blood pressure and kidney failure. PKD varies greatly in its severity, and some complications are preventable. Lifestyle changes and treatments might help reduce damage to your kidneys from complications. Polycystic kidney disease care at Mayo Clinic Polycystic kidney disease symptoms can include: - High blood pressure   - Back or side pain   - Headache   - A feeling of fullness in your abdomen   - Increased size of your abdomen due to enlarged kidneys   - Blood in your urine   - Kidney stones   - Kidney failure   - Urinary tract or kidney infections It's not uncommon for people to have polycystic kidney disease for years without knowing it. If you develop some of the signs and symptoms of polycystic kidney disease, see your doctor. If you have a first-degree relative - parent, sibling or child - with polycystic kidney disease, see your doctor to discuss screening for this disorder. Abnormal genes cause polycystic kidney disease, which means that in most cases, the disease runs in families. Rarely, a genetic mutation occurs on its own (spontaneous), so that neither parent has a copy of the mutated gene. The two main types of polycystic kidney disease, caused by different genetic flaws, are: -  Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Signs and symptoms of ADPKD often develop between the ages of 30 and 40. In the past, this type was called adult polycystic kidney disease, but children can develop the disorder.  Only one parent needs to have the disease for it to pass to the children. If one parent has ADPKD, each child has a 50 percent chance of getting the disease. This form accounts for about 90 percent of cases of polycystic kidney disease.   -  Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). This type is far less common than is ADPKD. The signs and symptoms often appear shortly after birth. Sometimes, symptoms don't appear until later in childhood or during adolescence.  Both parents must have abnormal genes to pass on this form of the disease. If both parents carry a gene for this disorder, each child has a 25 percent chance of getting the disease. Complications associated with polycystic kidney disease include: - High blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure is a common complication of polycystic kidney disease. Untreated, high blood pressure can cause further damage to your kidneys and increase your risk of heart disease and stroke.   -  Loss of kidney function. Progressive loss of kidney function is one of the most serious complications of polycystic kidney disease. Nearly half of those with the disease have kidney failure by age 60.  PKD can interfere with the ability of your kidneys to keep wastes from building to toxic levels, a condition called uremia. As the disease worsens, end-stage kidney (renal) failure may result, necessitating ongoing kidney dialysis or a transplant to prolong your life.   - Pregnancy complications. Pregnancy is successful for most women with polycystic kidney disease. In some cases, however, women may develop a life-threatening disorder called preeclampsia. Those most at risk have high blood pressure before they become pregnant.   - Growth of cysts in the liver. The likelihood of developing liver cysts for someone with polycystic kidney disease increases with age. While both men and women develop cysts, women often develop larger cysts. Female hormones might contribute to cyst development.   - Development of an aneurysm in the brain. A balloonlike bulge in a blood vessel (aneurysm) in your brain can cause bleeding (hemorrhage) if it ruptures. People with polycystic kidney disease have a higher risk of aneurysm. People with a family history of aneurysm seem to be at highest risk.   - Heart valve abnormalities. As many as 1 in 4 adults with polycystic kidney disease develops mitral valve prolapse. When this happens, the valve no longer closes properly, which allows blood to leak backward.   - Colon problems. Weaknesses and pouches or sacs in the wall of the colon (diverticulosis) may develop in people with polycystic kidney disease.   - Chronic pain. Pain is a common symptom for people with polycystic kidney disease. It often occurs in your side or back. The pain can also be associated with a urinary tract infection, a kidney stone or a malignancy. For polycystic kidney disease, certain tests can detect the size and number of kidney cysts you have and evaluate the amount of healthy kidney tissue, including: - Ultrasound. During an ultrasound, a wandlike device called a transducer is placed on your body. It emits sound waves that are reflected back to the transducer - like sonar. A computer translates the reflected sound waves into images of your kidneys. - CT scan. As you lie on a movable table, you're guided into a big, doughnut-shaped device that projects thin X-ray beams through your body. Your doctor is able to see cross-sectional images of your kidneys. - MRI scan. As you lie inside a large cylinder, magnetic fields and radio waves generate cross-sectional views of your kidneys. Treating polycystic kidney disease involves dealing with the following signs, symptoms and complications in their early stages: - High blood pressure. Controlling high blood pressure can delay the progression of the disease and slow further kidney damage. Combining a low-sodium, low-fat diet that's moderate in protein and calorie content with not smoking, increasing exercise and reducing stress may help control high blood pressure. However, medications are usually needed to control high blood pressure. Medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are often used to control high blood pressure. - Pain. You might be able to control the pain of polycystic kidney disease with over-the-counter medications containing acetaminophen. For some people, however, the pain is more severe and constant. In rare cases, your doctor might recommend surgery to remove cysts if they're large enough to cause pressure and pain. - Bladder or kidney infections. Prompt treatment of infections with antibiotics is necessary to prevent kidney damage. - Blood in the urine. You'll need to drink lots of fluids, preferably plain water, as soon as you notice blood in your urine to dilute the urine. Dilution might help prevent obstructive clots from forming in your urinary tract. - Kidney failure. If your kidneys lose their ability to remove waste products and extra fluids from your blood, you'll eventually need either dialysis or a kidney transplant. - Aneurysms. If you have polycystic kidney disease and a family history of ruptured brain (intracranial) aneurysms, your doctor may recommend regular screening for intracranial aneurysms. If an aneurysm is discovered, surgical clipping of the aneurysm to reduce the risk of bleeding may be an option, depending on its size. Nonsurgical treatment of small aneurysms may involve controlling high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, as well as quitting smoking."

        "query": "what is acute diverticulitis",
        "document": "Diverticulitis: Diverticula are small, bulging pouches that can form in the lining of your digestive system. They are found most often in the lower part of the large intestine (colon). Diverticula are common, especially after age 40, and seldom cause problems. Sometimes, however, one or more of the pouches become inflamed or infected. That condition is known as diverticulitis (die-vur-tik-yoo-LIE-tis). Diverticulitis can cause severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea and a marked change in your bowel habits. Mild diverticulitis can be treated with rest, changes in your diet and antibiotics. Severe or recurring diverticulitis may require surgery. The signs and symptoms of diverticulitis include: - Pain, which may be constant and persist for several days. Pain is usually felt in the lower left side of the abdomen, but may occur on the right, especially in people of Asian descent.   - Nausea and vomiting.   - Fever.   - Abdominal tenderness.   - Constipation or, less commonly, diarrhea. Diverticula usually develop when naturally weak places in your colon give way under pressure. This causes marble-sized pouches to protrude through the colon wall. Diverticulitis occurs when diverticula tear, resulting in inflammation or infection or both. Several factors may increase your risk of developing diverticulitis: - Aging. The incidence of diverticulitis increases with age.   - Obesity. Being seriously overweight increases your odds of developing diverticulitis. Morbid obesity may increase your risk of needing more-invasive treatments for diverticulitis.   - Smoking. People who smoke cigarettes are more likely than nonsmokers to experience diverticulitis.   - Lack of exercise. Vigorous exercise appears to lower your risk of diverticulitis.   - Diet high in animal fat and low in fiber, although the role of low fiber alone isn't clear.   - Certain medications. Several drugs are associated with an increased risk of diverticulitis, including steroids, opiates and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen (Aleve). Diverticulitis is usually diagnosed during an acute attack. Because abdominal pain can indicate a number of problems, your doctor will need to rule out other causes for your symptoms. Your doctor will likely start with a physical examination, including checking your abdomen for tenderness. Women, in addition, generally have a pelvic examination to rule out pelvic disease. After that, your doctor will likely recommend: - Blood and urine tests, to check for signs of infection. - Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age, to rule out pregnancy as a cause of abdominal pain. - Liver function tests, to rule out other causes of abdominal pain. - Stool test, to rule out infection in people who have diarrhea. - CT scan, which can indicate inflamed or infected pouches and confirm a diagnosis of diverticulitis. CT can also indicate the severity of diverticulitis and guide treatment. Diagnosis at Mayo Clinic Diverticulitis can be difficult to diagnose because abdominal pain is a symptom of many digestive disorders. Mayo Clinic has radiologists who specialize in digestive disorders and have experience distinguishing diverticulitis from other conditions. Mayo's digestive disease specialists (gastroenterologists) have experience diagnosing the severity of diverticulitis. Precise diagnosis is important for appropriate treatment. Treatment depends on the severity of your signs and symptoms. Uncomplicated diverticulitis If your symptoms are mild, you may be treated at home. Your doctor is likely to recommend: - Antibiotics, to treat infection. - A liquid diet for a few days while your bowel heals. Once your symptoms improve, you can gradually add solid food to your diet. - An over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). This treatment is successful in 70 to 100 percent of people with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Complicated diverticulitis If you have a severe attack or have other health problems, you'll likely need to be hospitalized. Treatment generally involves: - Intravenous antibiotics - Insertion of a tube to drain an abscess, if one has formed Surgery You'll likely need surgery to treat diverticulitis if: - You have a complication, such as perforation, abscess, fistula or bowel obstruction - You have had multiple episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis - You are immune compromised There are two main types of surgery: - Primary bowel resection. The surgeon removes diseased segments of your intestine and then reconnects the healthy segments (anastomosis). This allows you to have normal bowel movements. Depending on the amount of inflammation, you may have open surgery or a minimally invasive (laparoscopic) procedure. - Bowel resection with colostomy. If you have so much inflammation that it's not possible to rejoin your colon and rectum, the surgeon will perform a colostomy. An opening (stoma) in your abdominal wall is connected to the healthy part of your colon. Waste passes through the opening into a bag. Once the inflammation has eased, the colostomy may be reversed and the bowel reconnected. Follow-up care Your doctor may recommend colonoscopy six weeks after you recover from diverticulitis, especially if you haven't had the test in the previous year. There doesn't appear to be a direct link between diverticular disease and colon or rectal cancer. But colonoscopy - which isn't possible during a diverticulitis attack - can exclude colon cancer as a cause of your symptoms. Sometimes, surgery is recommended. But previous recommendations for surgery based on the number of attacks have been questioned, since most people do well even after two or more attacks. The decision on surgery is an individual one, and is often based on the frequency of attacks and whether complications have occurred. Treatment at Mayo Clinic Mayo Clinic specialists have experience treating both mild and severe diverticulitis. If you need surgery, Mayo surgeons can offer minimally invasive options - including laparoscopic, hand-assisted laparoscopic and robotic procedures - if appropriate. To help prevent diverticulitis: - Exercise regularly. Exercise promotes normal bowel function and reduces pressure inside your colon. Try to exercise at least 30 minutes on most days. - Eat more fiber. High-fiber foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains, soften waste material and help it pass more quickly through your colon. This reduces pressure inside your digestive tract. However, it isn't clear whether a high-fiber diet decreases the risk of diverticulitis. Eating seeds and nuts isn't associated with developing diverticulitis. - Drink plenty of fluids. Fiber works by absorbing water and increasing the soft, bulky waste in your colon. But if you don't drink enough liquid to replace what's absorbed, fiber can be constipating. Some experts suspect that people who develop diverticulitis may not have enough good bacteria in their colons. Probiotics - foods or supplements that contain beneficial bacteria - are sometimes suggested as a way to prevent diverticulitis. But that advice hasn't been scientifically validated."

        "query": "what is binge eating disorder",
        "document": "Binge eating disorder: Binge eating disorder is the most common type of eating disorder in the United States. People with binge eating disorder often feel out of control and eat a large amount of food at one time (called a binge). Unlike other eating disorders, people who have binge eating disorder do not throw up the food or exercise too much. Binge eating disorder is a serious health problem, but people with binge eating disorder can get better with treatment. Binge eating disorder is a type of eating disorder. Eating disorders are mental health problems that cause extreme and dangerous eating behaviors. These extreme eating behaviors cause other serious health problems and sometimes death. Some eating disorders also involve extreme exercise.  According to the American Psychiatric Association, women with binge eating disorder feel out of control and eat too much (binge), at least once a week for at least three months. During binges women with binge eating disorder usually eat faster than normal, eat until they are uncomfortable, eat when they are not physically hungry, and feel embarrassed, disgusted, or depressed because of the binges. Women with this type of eating disorder may be overweight or obese. Women with eating disorders, such as binge eating disorder, bulimia, and anorexia, have a mental health condition that affects how they eat, and sometimes how they exercise. These eating disorders threaten their health.  Unlike people with anorexia or bulimia, people with binge eating disorder do not throw up their food, exercise a lot, or starve themselves. People with binge eating disorder are often overweight or obese. But not all people with binge eating disorder are overweight, and being overweight does not always mean you have binge eating disorder.  It is possible to have more than one eating disorder in your lifetime. Regardless of what type of eating disorder you may have, you can get better with treatment. Binge eating disorder affects more than 3% of women in the United States. More than half of people with binge eating disorder are women.1  Binge eating disorder affects women of all races and ethnicities. It is the most common eating disorder among Hispanic, Asian-American, and African-American women.2,3,4  Some women may be more at risk for binge eating disorder. It can be difficult to tell whether someone has binge eating disorder. Many women with binge eating disorder hide their behavior because they are embarrassed.    You may have binge eating disorder if, for at least once a week over the past three months, you have binged. Binge eating disorder means you have at least three of these symptoms while binging:8  People with binge eating disorder may also have other mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. Researchers are not sure exactly what causes binge eating disorder and other eating disorders. Researchers think that eating disorders might happen because of a combination of a person's biology and life events. This combination includes having specific genes, a person's biology, body image and self-esteem, social experiences, family health history, and sometimes other mental health illnesses.  Studies suggest that people with binge eating disorder may use overeating as a way to deal with anger, sadness, boredom, anxiety, or stress.9,10    Researchers are studying how changing levels of brain chemicals may affect eating habits. Neuroimaging, or pictures of the brain, may lead to a better understanding of binge eating disorder.11  Learn more about current research on binge eating disorder. Many, but not all, women with binge eating disorder are overweight or obese. Obesity raises your risk for many serious health problems:12  People with binge eating disorder often have other serious mental health illnesses such as depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. These problems can seriously affect a woman's everyday life and can be treated. Your doctor or nurse will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history. It may be difficult to talk to a doctor or nurse about secret eating behaviors. But doctors and nurses want to help you be healthy. Being honest about your eating behaviors with a doctor or nurse is a good way to ask for help.  Your doctor may also do blood, urine, or other tests for other health problems, such as heart problems or gallbladder disease, that can be caused by binge eating disorder. Your doctor may refer you to a team of doctors, nutritionists, and therapists who will work to help you get better.  Treatment plans may include one or more of the following:  Most girls and women do get better with treatment and are able to eat in healthy ways again.14 Some may get better after the first treatment. Others get well but may relapse and need treatment again. Binge eating disorder can cause problems getting pregnant and during pregnancy. Pregnancy can also trigger binge eating disorder.  Obesity raises the level of the hormone estrogen in your body. Higher levels of estrogen can stop you from ovulating, or releasing an egg from the ovary. This can make it more difficult to get pregnant. However, if you do not want to have children right now and have sex, you should use birth control.  Overweight or obesity may also cause problems during pregnancy. Overweight and obesity raises your risk for:  Pregnancy can raise the risk for binge eating disorder in women who are at higher risk for eating disorders. In one study, almost half of the women with binge eating disorder got the condition during pregnancy. The research suggests that binge eating during pregnancy may be caused by:16  After pregnancy, postpartum depression and weight from pregnancy can trigger binge eating disorder in women with a history of binge eating. Women with binge eating disorder before pregnancy often gain more weight during pregnancy than women without an eating disorder. Researchers think that weight gain during pregnancy may cause some women who had binge eating disorder before pregnancy to binge eat during pregnancy.17 Yes. Women who have recovered from binge eating disorder, are at a healthy weight, and have normal menstrual cycles have a better chance of getting pregnant and having a safe and healthy pregnancy.  Tell your doctor if you had an eating disorder in the past and are trying to become pregnant. Maybe. Some medicines used to treat binge eating disorder can pass through breastmilk. Certain antidepressants can be used safely during breastfeeding.  Talk to your doctor to find out what medicine works best for you. Learn more about medicines and breastfeeding in our Breastfeeding. You can also enter a medicine into the LactMed database to find out if the medicine passes through breastmilk and about any possible side effects for your nursing baby.
