H4F5 is also highly deleted in type I SMA chromosomes, and thus is a candidate phenotypic modifier for SMA.\nThe molecular genetic basis of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder, is the loss of function of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1).",

    "326": "The conventional \"Warburg effect\" reffers to  the metabolic shift of cancer cells towards aerobic glycolysis, due to mitochondrial dysfunction. The \"reverse Warburg effect\" or \"parasitic\" energy-transfer, is a model of \"two-compartment tumor metabolism\". In this model, cancer cells secrete hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), initiating oxidative stress and aerobic glycolysis in the tumor stroma. The cancer-associated fibroblasts of the stroma are glycolytic and lack detectable mitochondria. These glycolytic stromal cells produce mitochondrial fuels (L-lactate, ketone bodies and chemical building blocks, such as amino acids -glutamine-, and nucleotides) that are then transferred to oxidative epithelial cancer cells. Lactate and ketones drive cancer cell  oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (OXPHOS), and building blocks sustain the anabolic needs of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Therefore, according to the \"reverse Warburg effect\", stromal catabolism fuels anabolic tumor growth via energy transfer. Thus, in \"reverse Warburg effect\" the cancer-associated fibroblasts of the stroma undergo aerobic glycolysis, rather than epithelial cancer cells themselves, as proposed by the conventional \"Warburg effect\".",

The modulation of AT-1R/AMPK-MAPK pathway might play crucial roles for the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy and it could become an important therapeutic target to ameliorate the diabetic cardiomyopathy.

Dendritic cells grab antigens from viruses, bacteria, or other organisms and wave them at T cells to recruit their help in an initial T cell immune response. This works well against foreign cells that enter the body, but cancer cells often evade the self/non-self detection system. By modifying dendritic cells, researchers are able to trigger a special kind of autoimmune response that includes a T cell attack of the cancer cells. Because a cancer antigen alone is not enough to rally the immune troops, scientists first fuse a cytokine to a tumor antigen with the hope that this will send a strong antigenic signal. Next, they grow a patient's dendritic cells in the incubator and let them take up this fused cytokine-tumor antigen. This enables the dendritic cells to mature and eventually display the same tumor antigens as appear on the patient's cancer cells. When these special mature dendritic cells are given back to the patient, they wave their newly acquired tumor antigens at the patient's immune system, and those T cells that can respond mount an attack on the patient's cancer cells.",

Our data provided the first evidence that increased expression of CYLD directly blocks TRAIL-induced NF - B activation, and consequently increases TRAIL-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells. CYLD may act as a therapeutic target of lung cancer. Targeting CYLD, in combination with TRAIL, may be a new strategy to treat lung cancer with high NF - B activity. Cyld encodes a 956-amino acid deubiquitinating enzyme, which is a negative regulator of nuclear factor kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Mutations that truncate and inactivate the carboxyl-terminal deubiquitinating domain of CYLD underlie the development of skin appendage tumors in humans, whereas down-regulation of Cyld expression has been associated with the development of various types of human malignancies including lung cancer. To establish an animal model of human CYLD inactivation and characterize the biological role of CYLD in vivo, we generated mice carrying a homozygous deletion of Cyld exon 9 mice ) using a conditional approach.

The Ca(2+) paradox represents a good model to study Ca(2+) overload injury in ischemic heart diseases. The Ca(2+) paradox can be elicited by perfusing isolated hearts with Ca(2+)-free media for 3 min or 5 min followed by 30 min of Ca(2+) repletion. A possible mechanism for the 'calcium paradox' is that exposure to a calcium-free medium removes extracellular calcium rendering the sarcolemma more permeable to calcium. On calcium repletion, cell injury is triggered by calcium influx. Cardiac dysfunction due to Ca2+ -paradox may be associated with apoptosis.",

    "490": "LSD1 represents a central regulator of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. LSD1 knockdown (LSD1-kd) expanded progenitor numbers by enhancing their proliferative behavior. LSD1-kd led to an extensive expansion of granulomonocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors. In contrast, terminal granulopoiesis, erythropoiesis and platelet production were severely inhibited. The only exception was monopoiesis, which was promoted by LSD1 deficiency. Importantly, we showed that peripheral blood granulocytopenia, monocytosis, anemia and thrombocytopenia were reversible after LSD1-kd termination. Extramedullary splenic hematopoiesis contributed to the phenotypic reversion, and progenitor populations remained expanded. LSD1-kd was associated with the upregulation of key hematopoietic genes, including Gfi1b, Hoxa9 and Meis1, which are known regulators of the HSC/progenitor compartment. We also demonstrated that LSD1-kd abrogated Gfi1b-negative autoregulation by crossing LSD1-kd with Gfi1b:GFP mice. There is also epigenetic regulation of hematopoietic differentiation by Gfi-1 and Gfi-1b that is mediated by the cofactors CoREST and LSD1. A short Gfi-1B isoform controls erythroid differentiation by recruiting the LSD1-CoREST complex through the dimethylation of its SNAG domain. The enzymatic domain of LSD1 plays an important role in repressing the TAL1-directed transcription of GAL4 reporter linked to a thymidine kniase minimal promoter. Furthermore,  the TAL1-associated LSD1, HDAC1, and their enzymatic activities are coordinately down-regulated during the early phases of erythroid differentiation. Consistent with the rapid changes of TAL1-corepressor complex during differentiation, TAL1 recruits LSD1 to the silenced p4.2 promoter in undifferentiated, but not in differentiated, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of LSD1 in MEL cells resulted in derepression of the TAL1 target gene accompanied by increasing dimeH3K4 at the promoter region. Thus, it appears that histone lysine demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate TAL1-mediated transcription and that the dynamic regulation of TAL1-associated LSD1/HDAC1 complex may determine the onset of erythroid differentiation programs. Furthermore, RUNX1 has been shown to be part of a large transcription factor complex, together with LDB1, GATA1, TAL1, and ETO2 in erythroid cells. RUNX1 interacts with LSD1 and MYEF2 in erythroid cells. MYEF2 is bound in undifferentiated cells and is lost upon differentiation, whereas LSD1 is bound in differentiated cells. Finally, LSD1 also participates in the trans-repressive effects of SALL4. Based on luciferase assays, the amine oxidase domain of LSD1 is important in suppressing SALL4-mediated reporter transcription. In freshly isolated adult mouse bone marrows, both SALL4 and LSD1 proteins are preferentially expressed in undifferentiated progenitor cells and co-localize in the nuclei. Further sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that these two factors share the same binding sites at the promoter regions of important hematopoietic regulatory genes including EBF1, GATA1, and TNF.",

The production of human cardiac progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells provides an amenable source of cells for applications in drug discovery, disease modeling, regenerative medicine, and cardiotoxicity screening. In addition, the ability to derive human-induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic tissues, combined with current high-throughput screening and pharmacogenomics, may help realize the use of these cells to fulfill the potential of personalized medicine. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) provide a unique opportunity to study \"disease in a dish\" within a defined genetic and environmental background.

There is no ideal pattern of vancomycin dosing; vancomycin dosages must be individualized. Because vancomycin activity is primarily time-dependent, the 24-h area under the curve (AUC0-24h) divided by the minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) value (AUC0-24h/MIC) is a better predictor of efficacy.

Snord116 expression level in ventral hypothalamic dissections including ARC was significantly greater (by 2-fold) than that in cortex; and its expression level in dorsal hypothalamic dissections including PVN was double that in cortex. The enhanced expression pattern of Snord116 in hypothalamic nuclei was observed at weaning and young adult stages, but less obvious neonatally when expression was significantly more widespread. Therefore the expression of Snord116 likely is regulated developmentally.\nSnord116del mice with paternally derived deletion lack expression of this snoRNA. They have early-onset postnatal growth deficiency, but normal fertility and lifespan. While pituitary structure and somatotrophs are normal, liver Igf1 mRNA is decreased.

    "610": "An unusual feature of the Diptera is that homologous chromosomes are intimately synapsed in somatic cells. At a number of loci in Drosophila, this pairing can significantly influence gene expression. Such influences were first detected within the bithorax complex (BX-C) by E.B. Lewis, who coined the term transvection to describe them. Most cases of transvection involve the action of enhancers in trans. At several loci deletion of the promoter greatly increases this action in trans, suggesting that enhancers are normally tethered in cis by the promoter region. Transvection can also occur by the action of silencers in trans or by the spreading of position effect variegation from rearrangements having heterochromatic breakpoints to paired unrearranged chromosomes. Although not demonstrated, other cases of transvection may involve the production of joint RNAs by trans-splicing. Several cases of transvection require Zeste, a DNA-binding protein that is thought to facilitate homolog interactions by self-aggregation. Genes showing transvection can differ greatly in their response to pairing disruption. In several cases, transvection appears to require intimate synapsis of homologs. However, in at least one case (transvection of the iab-5,6,7 region of the BX-C), transvection is independent of synapsis within and surrounding the interacting gene. The latter example suggests that transvection could well occur in organisms that lack somatic pairing. In support of this, transvection-like phenomena have been described in a number of different organisms, including plants, fungi, and mammals.",

Phospholamban (PLN) is a small integral membrane protein, which binds and inhibits in a yet unknown fashion the Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Based on structural and dynamics data, a model in which PLN undergoes allosteric activation upon encountering SERCA has been proposed. The allosteric regulation of SERCA depends on the conformational equilibrium of PLN, whose cytoplasmic regulatory domain interconverts between three different states: a ground T state (helical and membrane associated), an excited R state (unfolded and membrane detached), and a B state (extended and enzyme-bound), which is noninhibitory. Phosphorylation of PLN shifts the populations toward the B state, increasing SERCA activity.

However, the mechanisms explaining oncogene addiction remain elusive. We propose that  addiction  may be an illusion generated as a consequence of differential attenuation rates of prosurvival and proapoptotic signals emanating from an oncoprotein acutely following its inactivation. According to this model, which we call  oncogenic shock,  prosurvival signals dissipate quickly on oncoprotein inactivation whereas proapoptotic signals linger sufficiently long to commit the cell to an apoptotic death.

    "818": "HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a \"young cell\" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a \"younger\" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGF\u03b21 under exogenous TGF\u03b21 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.",

    "823": "Ubiquitination is best known for its role in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome, but evidence of the nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin is also rapidly accumulating. One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Some TRAF proteins, such as TRAF2 and TRAF3, have recently been shown to have a positive role in the canonical pathway that activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) through IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), but a negative role in the noncanonical pathway that activates NF-kappaB through IKKalpha. These opposing roles of TRAF proteins may be linked to their ability to synthesize distinct forms of polyubiquitin chains. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20.

Pull-down experiments and surface plasmon resonance data indicate a direct interaction between NS3 and NS5B that is primarily mediated through the protease domain of NS3. This interaction reduces the basal ATPase activity of NS3. However, NS5B stimulates product formation in RNA unwinding experiments under conditions of excess nucleic acid substrate. When the concentrations of NS3 and NS5B are in excess of nucleic acid substrate, NS5B reduces the rate of NS3-catalyzed unwinding. Under pre-steady-state conditions, in which NS3 and substrate concentrations are similar, product formation increased in the presence of NS5B.

Common pathophysiologic features of HF include changes in left ventricle structure, function, and neurohormonal activation. Disturbed myocardial calcium handling is also one of the pathophysiologic hallmarks of congestive heart failure. One of the hallmarks of chronic congestive heart failure is an increase in sympathetic tone to the peripheral circulation and to the heart. It has been proposed that the activation of neurohormonal pathways and the formation of oxygen free radicals ultimately lead to the activation of a family of transcription factors that are involved in cardiac and vascular remodelling which are hallmarks of congestive heart failure. Myocardial failure ultimately leads to exaggerated neurohumoral compensatory mechanisms and derangements of the peripheral circulation, which are the hallmarks of congestive heart failure. Two additional hallmarks of this syndrome are sodium and water retention. Accumulation of oxidized matrix between the endothelium and cardiac muscle, and endocardial endothelial dysfunction, are also hallmarks of congestive heart failure.",

However, our analyses indicate that these MDR efflux pumps did not arise through recent mutations in genes encoding transporters that changed their substrate specificities.\n\nInstead, such MDR pumps are encoded within the genomes of virtually all microorganisms, so these genes are present and thus need only to be activated to become problematic. Moreover, lateral transfer of genes among bacteria has occurred frequently, particularly for plasmid-encoded systems, suggesting that such genes can be acquired fairly readily even if they are not initially present. Finally, although mutations that enable transporters to act on different types of substrate are rare, experiments and phylogenetic analyses indicate that simple point mutations can readily narrow or broaden a particular transporter's specificity toward a single class of compounds (e.g., sugars, amino acids, or drugs).",

In addition, interventions, such as hypergravity and 5-Aza treatment, induce expression of early muscle and cardiac markers like GATA-4 in BMSCs. A subpopulation of primitive cells from rat heart, expressing c-kit and myogenic transcriptional factors, GATA-4 and MEF 2C, exhibit a high in vitro proliferative potential. Progeny of these implanted cells have been shown to migrate along the infarcted scar, reconstitute regenerated cardiomyocytes with incorporation into host myocardium, and inhibit cardiac remodeling with decreased scar formation. In another study, TGF-beta has been shown to conduct the myogenic differentiation of stem cells by upregulating GATA-4 and NKx-2.5 expression and the intramyocardial implantation of TGF-beta-preprogrammed stem cells effectively assisted the myocardial regeneration.

The most common form of breast cancer begins in cells lining the ducts that carry milk to the nipple (ductal cancer). Other forms of breast cancer begin in the glands that produce milk (lobular cancer) or in other parts of the breast.\nEarly breast cancer usually does not cause pain and may exhibit no noticeable symptoms. As the cancer progresses, signs and symptoms can include a lump or thickening in or near the breast; a change in the size or shape of the breast; nipple discharge, tenderness, or retraction (turning inward); and skin irritation, dimpling, or scaliness. These changes can occur as part of many different conditions, however. Having one or more of these symptoms does not mean that a person definitely has breast cancer.\nIn some cases, cancerous tumors can invade surrounding tissue and spread to other parts of the body. If breast cancer spreads, cancerous cells most often appear in the bones, liver, lungs, or brain. Tumors that begin at one site and then spread to other areas of the body are called metastatic cancers.\nA small percentage of all breast cancers cluster in families. Hereditary cancers are those associated with inherited gene mutations. Hereditary breast cancers tend to occur earlier in life than noninherited (sporadic) cases and are more likely to involve both breasts.\n\nVariations of the BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCT, and P53 genes increase the risk of developing breast cancer.\nThe and NFR2, HER2 and TOP2A genes are associated with breast cancer.",

    "1261": "MutT proteins belong to a class of Nudix hydrolases. The common substrate structure for the proteins of the functionally diverse Nudix superfamily is nucleotide-diphosphate-X, where X is a large variety of leaving groups. The activities of Nudix hydrolases usually result in the release of an inorganic phosphate ion or of a product bearing a terminal phosphate moiety. MutT proteins hydrolyze 8-oxo-G nucleoside triphosphates/diphosphates to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates and sanitize the nucleotide pool. MutT proteins cleave 8-oxo-dGTP (8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate) at the \u03b1-\u03b2 position; they also cleave 8-oxo-dGTP at the \u03b2-\u03b3 phosphate bond at a rate of 3% of that recorded for hydrolysis at the \u03b1-\u03b2 position. 8-oxo-dGTP induces A to C transversions when misincorporated in DNA opposite to template A. By hydrolyzing 8-oxo-dGTP before their incorporation into DNA, MutT proteins play a critical role in allowing bacteria to avoid A-to-C mutations, which are a hallmark of MutT deficiency. Thus, MutT proteins prevent oxidative DNA lesions, as part of the GO system. Oxidized nucleotides can occur when bacteria are exposed to reactive oxygen species. Also, reactive oxygen species are produced as side products of oxygen utilization, leading to the oxidation of nucleic acids and their precursor nucleotides. Distinct from the Escherichia coli MutT, which hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, the mycobacterial proteins hydrolyze not only 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP but also dCTP and 5-methyl-dCTP. Moreover, the hydrolysis of 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP in mycobacteria seems to be catalysed in a two-stage mechanism, since MutT converts these oxidized nucleoside triphosphates to their corresponding nucleoside diphosphates, and not to monophosphates.",

CMTs are characterized by the presence of a chromatin-associated domain (chromodomain) inserted within the catalytic protein motifs I and IV. CMTs have likely evolved because of  the high levels of CpNpG methylation present in plant genomes relative to animal genomes. The targeting of CMT methylation is accomplished by short interfering RNA (siRNA) pathways and histone methylation (H3K9, H3K27). It has been shown that transposons are in vivo targets of CMT-dependent methylation, suggesting that CMTs play a role in the plant genome surveillance. In Arabidopsis, CMTs play a key role in egg cell reprogramming and normal embryogenesis during the first few divisions of the zygote by mediating transposon and euchromatin epigenetic gene silencing. In tomatoes, CMTs are preferentially expressed in the pericarp during fruit development which suggests involvement of CMTs in the locus-specific control of methylation in the pericarp during fruit growth.",

Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture.

Recently, we found that aPKC can also phosphorylate Par6 to drive EMT and increase the migratory potential of non-small cell lung cancer cells. We propose that the regulation of EMT by SIRT1 involves modulation of, and cooperation with, the EMT inducing transcription factor ZEB1. Knockdown of Numb by shRNA in MDCK cells led to a lateral to apical translocation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin, active F-actin polymerization, mis-localization of Par3 and aPKC, a decrease in cell-cell adhesion and an increase in cell migration and proliferation.

An NGS based mutation screening procedure allowing the detection of inherited Alu insertions within any predefined sequence was used for the case of c.1739_1740insAlu in BRCA1 and c.156_157insAlu in BRCA2. Another NGS study screened BRCA1 and BRCA2 resulting in  overall sensitivity for SOLiD and PGM of 97.8% (95% CI = 94.7 to 100.0) and 98.9% (95% CI = 96.8 to 100.0) respectively. The specificity for the SOLiD platform was high, at 100.0% (95% CI = 99.3 to 100.0). PGM correctly identified all 3 indels, but 68 false-positive indels were also called. Genes known to cause deafness were sequenced by the Illumina NGS platform. Results demonstrated that targeted exons captured by our approach achieved specificity, multiplexicity, uniformity, and depth of coverage suitable for accurate sequencing applications by the NGS systems. Reliable genotype calls for various homozygous and heterozygous mutations were achieved. In the context of von Willebrand disease 43 mutations, including 36 substitutions, 2 intronic splice site mutations, 2 indels, and 3 deletions were screened on the next-generation sequencing instrument. This demonstrated that at least 350 patients and relatives per run can be simultaneously analyzed in a fast, inexpensive manner.

Central to stationary-phase mutagenesis in B. subtilis is the requirement for Mfd protein (transcription repair coupling factor). The B. subtilis' ability to accumulate chromosomal mutations under conditions of starvation is influenced by cell differentiation and transcriptional derepression, as well as by proteins homologous to transcription and repair factors. Under conditions of nutritional stress, the processing of deaminated bases in B. subtilis may normally occur in an error-prone manner to promote adaptive mutagenesis. A functional RecA protein is not required for adaptive mutagenesis, which seems to be independent of recombination-dependent repair and, in some cases, of the Y DNA polymerases. Oxidative stress-induced DNA damage has been associated with adaptive mutagenesis. The occurrence of such mutations is exacerbated by reactive oxygen species. Starved B. subtilis cells lacking a functional error prevention GO (8-oxo-G) system (composed of YtkD, MutM, and YfhQ) had a dramatic propensity to increase the number of stationary-phase-induced revertants.

If these ancient CNEs are indeed enhancers directing tissue-specific expression of Hox genes, divergence of their sequences in vertebrate lineages might have led to altered expression patterns and presumably the functions of their associated Hox genes.  When compared, the amphioxus Hox cluster with the human HoxA, HoxB, HoxC, and HoxD clusters were found to have several conserved noncoding regions, both in intergenic and intronic regions.

The open chromatin of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) condenses into repressive heterochromatin as cells exit the pluripotent state. The relation between alterations in chromatin structure and changes in gene expression during cell differentiation has served as a paradigm to understand the link between genome organization and function. Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin structure during reprogramming and differentiation. Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales.

    "1482": "The myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) proteins are MADS-box transcription factors that are essential for differentiation of all muscle lineages but their mechanisms of action remain largely undefined. MEF2C expression initiates cardiomyogenesis, resulting in the up-regulation of Brachyury T, bone morphogenetic protein-4, Nkx2-5, GATA-4, cardiac alpha-actin, and myosin heavy chain expression. Inactivation of the MEF2C gene causes cardiac developmental arrest and severe downregulation of a number of cardiac markers including atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). BMP-2, a regulator of cardiac development during embryogenesis, was shown to increase PI 3-kinase activity in cardiac precursor cells, resulting in increased expression of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) and MEF-2A. Furthermore, expression of MEF-2A increased MHC expression in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Other studies showed that Gli2 and MEF2C proteins form a complex, capable of synergizing on cardiomyogenesis-related promoters. Dominant interference of calcineurin/mAKAP binding blunts the increase in MEF2 transcriptional activity seen during myoblast differentiation, as well as the expression of endogenous MEF2-target genes. These findings show that MEF-2 can direct early stages of cell differentiation into a cardiomyogenic pathway.",

    "1497": "The Ada O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase is a multifunctional protein, product of the ada gene. Ada functions in DNA repair by direct dealkylation of alkylated DNA lesions, such as the toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic O6-alkylguanine (O6-AlkG) and O4-alkylthymine (O4-AlkT) which are restored to guanine and thymine. Ada accepts stoichiometrically the alkyl group from O6-alkylguanine in DNA at the Cys-321 residue and from alkyl phosphotriester at the Cys-69 residue. When methylated at Cys-69, Ada becomes a transcriptional activator of the genes in the ada regulon, including its own. The ada gene controls the inducible resistance to alkylation mutagenesis and killing (the adaptive response). Ada alkyltransferase (ATase) is induced by exposure to low doses of methylating agents. During exponential growth, Ada removes lesions responsible for G:C to A:T transitions and G:C to C:G transversions, while in stationary populations it removes lesions causing G:C to A:T and A:T to G:C transitions, and G:C to C:G, A:T to C:G, and A:T to T:A transversions.

Pharmacologic actions of ascorbate against cancer cells remain to be fully understood. It is thought that high dose ascorbate is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cell lines through the generation of extracellular hydrogen peroxide.

This analeptic action is attributable to stimulation of cholinergic neurons in the septo-hippocampal area and to the presence of terminals containing TRH in the lateral septum and TRH receptors concentrated especially in the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca. It has also been suggested that TRH localized in the pineal gland has a part in activating the neuronal mechanisms of arousal. Associated with the arousal effect and especially evident in variously originated shock conditions are the activating effects of TRH on vegetative functions (body temperature, circulation, the gastrointestinal tract). These stimulatory activities on the CNS were the rationale for therapeutic use of TRH in the initial treatment of coma due to brain trauma.

The very high affinity of the biotin/(strept)avidin system also offers the potential for the single-step capture of lower abundance protein complexes, such as transcription factor complexes. The identification of short peptide tags that are efficiently biotinylated by the bacterial BirA biotin ligase led to an approach for the single-step purification of transcription factor complexes by specific in vivo biotinylation tagging. A short sequence tag fused N-terminally to the transcription factor of interest is very efficiently biotinylated by BirA coexpressed in the same cells, as was demonstrated by the tagging of the essential hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1. The direct binding to streptavidin of biotinylated GATA-1 in nuclear extracts resulted in the single-step capture of the tagged factor and associated proteins, which were eluted and identified by mass spectrometry. This led to the characterization of several distinct GATA-1 complexes with other transcription factors and chromatin remodeling cofactors, which are involved in activation and repression of gene targets.

It is characterized by a marked increase in the thickness of the epithelial layer and the accumulation of excessive amounts of connective tissue.  Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), which is a potent epithelial cell mitogen that has been implicated in other hyperplastic conditions could be involved in the molecular pathology of GO. Also, since cathepsin-L deficiency was reported to be associated with thickening of the skin, impaired cathepsin-L activity may play a key role in the establishment of skin and gingival abnormalities seen in I-cell disease. In addition, reduced cathepsin-L activity may play an important role in inducing drug-induced gingival overgrowth. Furthermore, the enhanced proliferation of gingival fibroblasts observed in this disease could be caused at least partly by the effects of the drugs on the cell cycle and cyclin expression in these cells. The increase in cell growth that occurs in drug-induced gingival overgrowth may be mediated by over-expression of cyclin B1.",

Exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) activate pre-mRNA splicing by promoting the use of the flanking splice sites. Some of these variants may have an effect on pre-mRNA splicing, either by altering degenerate positions of splice site sequences or by affecting intronic or exonic splicing regulatory sequences such as exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). For inherited disease, the main mechanism responsible for the splicing defect is splice site loss, whereas for cancer the predominant mechanism of splicing disruption is predicted to be exon skipping via loss of exonic splicing enhancers or gain of exonic splicing silencer elements. FELINES was shown to be useful for characterizing branchsites, polypyrimidine tracts and 5' and 3' splice sites in the intron databases and exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) in S.pombe exons.

These recently identified transcripts either exist stably in cells (stable unannotated transcripts, SUTs) or are rapidly degraded by the RNA surveillance pathway (cryptic unstable transcripts, CUTs)",

Although global DNA demethylation has been observed after treatment, it is unclear to what extent demethylation induces changes in nucleosome occupancy, a key determinant of gene expression. In order to systematically evaluate potential diversities among CGIs and ultimately to illuminate the link between diversity of CGIs and their epigenetic variation, we analyzed the nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps  of multiple cellular origins. Using this global approach, we observe the dependency of nucleosome occupancy upon the DNA methylation status. Exonic DNA methylation seems to function together with exonic nucleosomes and H3K36me3 for the proper splicing of transcripts with different expression levels. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this \"ground state\" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy. ",

Strelka is a method for somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor impurity without requiring purity estimates.

However, the applicability of this method has been impaired by the difficulty of cleanly modifying protein thiols by large PEG reagents. To establish a more robust method for redox-selective PEGylation a Click chemistry approach has been developed where free thiol groups are first labelled with a reagent modified to contain an alkyne moiety, which is subsequently Click-reacted with a PEG molecule containing a complementary azide function. This strategy can be adapted to study reversibly reduced or oxidised cysteines.

We describe a minisequencing protocol for screening DNA samples for the presence of 12 mutations in the human melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R), eight of which are associated with the red hair phenotype. The human MC1R gene is highly polymorphic and certain allelic variants of the gene are associated with red hair phenotype, melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Thus, at least in Spain, regions at opposite ends of the incident UV-B radiation distribution show significantly different frequencies for the melanoma-risk allele V60L (a mutation also associated to red hair and fair skin and even blonde hair), with higher frequency of V60L at those regions of lower incident UV-B radiation.
